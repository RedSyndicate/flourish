The common name, Mulga"" is an Australian Aboriginal word that means dream seed, both the tree and it’s seed are part of their mythology. The canopy can extend to the ground. Typically bottom branches are trimmed to expose the trunk(s) and give the tree an umbrella form. Acacia aneura is unusual in that it has an open flowering cycle. The trees produce small, sulphur yellow, rod shaped flower about 3/4"" long. Tan pods (1"" to 1 1/2"") mature from these flowers and are ultimately dropped. Once this flowering cycle is complete another one begins. Trees may produce 3 to 4 flower cycles per year with the heaviest flowering usually occurring in the spring or following summer rains.

Trees commonly sold in commerce as Italian cypress are of the familiar narrow-columnar or fastigiate form that typically grows 40-60’ (less frequently to 80’) tall. This columnar/fastigiate form (sometime referred to as C. s. var. sempervirens, C. s. ‘Stricta’ or Stricta Group), is unknown to the wild, but was the tree originally described by Linneaus as Cupressus sempervirens and is the cypress of classical literature that has been commonly planted in Italian classic gardens since Renaissance times. This columnar/fastigiate form features scale-like dark gray-green leaves on upright branches. After shedding the seeds, the cone persists on the tree for several years because, as with many species of Cupressus, C. sempervirens displays varying levels of serotiny: cones may remain unopened on the tree for many years until a fire induces them to open and subsequently to shed viable seed.","Green, Yellow","Tap, Long Rhizome",Winter - Early Spring,Summer - Fall,Medium,Columnar,Fast,Minor,Minor,Full_Sun,7 -- 11,Moderate,6.1 - 7.8,"Hedge, Windbreak","Aromatics/Fragrance, Essential Oil, Medicine, Ornamental, Soap, Wood"

In California it is also locally abundant in the Klamath Mountains. Mountain hemlock commonly occurs as a dominant or codominant in high-elevation alpine or subalpine forests. In western Washington and Oregon, the mountain hemlock zone is the highest forested zone. Mountain hemlock is often codominant with Pacific silver fir (Abies amabilis). Because mountain hemlock is shallow rooted it is very susceptible to windthrow. In the coastal strip of British Columbia and Alaska, wind commonly destroys mountain hemlock by uprooting it. Mountain hemlock is a native, slow-growing, coniferous, evergreen tree usually 75 to 100 feet (23-30 m) tall and 2.5 to 3.5 feet (0.8-1 m) in diameter.

The maximum age recorded is in excess of 700 years. Western hemlock seed appears to germinate well and seedlings grow well on almost all natural seedbeds whether rotten wood, undisturbed bed duff and litter, or bare mineral soil. The principal requirement for adequate development on any seedbed appears to be adequate moisture.

It likes partial shade especially in hot summers and will not tolerate poor drainage. Reproduces mainly by seed, but also spreads vegetatively via suckering and layering. Birds eat the berries and spread the seeds to new areas. Creates deep shade under its canopy. The common holly should be raised from seed. Being slow of germination it is advisable, as with Crataegus, to mix the berries with sand or fine earth in a heap, which should be exposed for a year to all weathers and turned occasionally. This rots the outer covering and allows the two to four nuts or seeds each fruit contains to separate. They arc then sown (soil and seed together) shallowly.

It is also drought resistant and well adapted to adverse climatic conditions and soil moisture conditions; prolonged drought may however kill seedlings. In its natural habitat, the species tolerates a wide temperature range. Mature trees withstand light frost, waterlogging and tolerate temperatures of up to 50 deg. C. In addition to rain, trees require a dry season of 2-6 months. The lateral spread of roots on this species, about 9 m in 18 years, is greater than most other species; moreover it produces root suckers profusely.

However, holm oak is less adapted to extreme drought in comparison with other evergreen Mediterranean tree species. In the Iberian Peninsula the holm oak woodlands are historically managed as savannah-like ecosystems, with large, isolated trees emerging from a grassland. These formations, known as dehesas in Spain and montados in Portugal, provide trees for shading livestock, firewood from pruning and refuge and breeding sites for a large number of vertebrates, whereas the grassland is used by cows and sheep for milk and meat production, and acorns for feeding pigs. The sustainable and ecological ecosystems are managed by preventing woody plants from invading grasslands.

E. guineensis needs a good moisture supply and open areas as they cannot compete with faster-growing tree species. E. guineensis does not grow under continuous flooding but is tolerant of fluctuating water tables with periods of standing water.

Drimys lanceolata, commonly known as mountain pepper, is a medium sized red-stemmed, dense, evergreen shrub that is native to woodlands and cool temperate rainforests in the southeastern parts of the Commonwealth of Australia (Victoria, New South Wales and Tasmania). In Tasmania, it commonly grows from sea level to alpine regions. This shrub typically matures to 6-10’ tall and to 4-8’ wide over time. Showy red stems are clad with contrasting aromatic, leathery, lanceolate to narrow-elliptic leaves (to 5” long) which are deep glossy green above and pale green beneath. Pale yellow to creamy white flowers bloom in April-May. Male flowers usually have 5-8 petals whereas female flowers usually have 4 petals. Flowers on female plants, if pollinated, are followed by spherical black berries (to 1/3” diameter) which ripen in early fall.

Common in brushy areas on level uplands, stony hillsides, and lower slopes from Houston and Bryan, Texas, in the east, west to Big Bend in west Texas and south to Nuevo Leon in northeastern Mexico. Very common in central and south Texas. This well-shaped, small tree is valued primarily for its striking trunk and branches, which are a smooth, pale greyish white or whitish grey, peeling off to reveal subtle greys, whites, and pinks beneath. The fruits, borne on female trees, are edible once soft, with a flavor some liken to prunes, and are favorites of many birds and mammals. It is extremely drought-tolerant and disease-resistant and is ideal for small spaces in full sun. The heartwood, found only in very large trunks, is black, like that of the related ebony (Diospyros ebenum), while the sapwood is clear yellow. Several characteristics enable Texas persimmon to survive in semiarid environments.

GENERAL DISTRIBUTION: Pitch pine occupies eastern United States habitats from central Maine south to northern Georgia. There are outlying pitch pine populations as far west as western Kentucky. Pitch pine is most common on the Atlantic Coastal Plain. There are 2 disjunct pitch pine populations in Canada. Both Canadian populations occur along the St Lawrence River, 1 in extreme southwestern Quebec and the other in extreme southeastern Ontario. The US Geological Survey provides a distributional map of pitch pine. HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES: Pitch pine is often dominant in pine barrens vegetation in the northeastern United States. On extremely harsh sites it may represent a climax vegetation type, but most often pitch pine forests are early seral and are replaced by oaks (Quercus spp.) and other hardwoods in the absence of fire.

Scots pine is frequently used in dendrochronology, because it is relatively long lived and often grows in marginal conditions, where small fluctuations in temperature and/or moisture can have a noticeable effect on its growth. It is best to sow the seed in individual pots in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe if this is possible otherwise in late winter. A short stratification of 6 weeks at 4°c can improve the germination of stored seed. Plant seedlings out into their permanent positions as soon as possible and protect them for their first winter or two. Plants have a very sparse root system and the sooner they are planted into their permanent positions the better they will grow. Trees should be planted into their permanent positions when they are quite small, between 30 and 90cm. We actually plant them out when they are about 5 - 10cm tall. So long as they are given a very good weed-excluding mulch they establish very well. Larger trees will check badly and hardly put on any growth for several years.

5052,Sydney Golden Wattle (Long Leaved Wattle),Acacia longifolia,ACLO,Evergreen Tree,20,20,48,Spring-Fall,"A. longifolia preferred habitats are full sunny, sandy coasts and dunes. Can be found also in woodlands, riparian zones, scrubs and grasslands. In areas where it has become naturalised in Australia, it grows on roadsides, along watercourses, in swamps and in native bushland. An attractive ornamental species with dark green foliage and bright yellow flowers; does best in the higher rainfall areas. The var. sophorae is recommended for planting as a low windbreak and sand-binder in coastal areas. Both have a fast growth rate. The plant is a shrubby tree that can form thickets that may be problematic. In terms of changes in fire regimes, the presence of A. longifolia (especially thickets) increases the risk and intensity of fires. Though the seeds are not adapted for long-distance dispersal, they are plentiful and have some dormancy that allows the plant to form massive seedbanks, making long-term control difficult unless early eradication is possible. The long-lived seeds of this species are stimulated to germinate by fire and very dense populations can follow fires, particularly where the indigenous vegetation has been removed or significantly disturbed.",Yellow,"Tap, Long Rhizome",Early Summer - Summer,Fall - Winter,Fine,Rounded,Fast,Minor,Minor,Full_Sun,9 -- 11,"Moderate, Dry",6.5 - 8.0,"Erosion Control, Hedge, Insectory, Nitrogen Fixer, Nitrogen Fixer, Nurse, Soil Builder, Windbreak","Aromatics/Fragrance, Coppice, Dye, Food, Food, Oil, Wax, Resin or Polish, Ornamental, Wood"

The literature reports mature heights in native Australian stands ranging from 6 to 8 feet all the way up to reports of trees nearly 30 feet tall. Native primarily to northern Australian it is found in the northern reaches of New South Wales and in New Holland on the eastern coast. It grows in open woodlands on sandy soils and stony ridges. Trees are very tolerant of maritime exposure in their native environment, though they are often severely wind-shaped and can be semi-prostrate. Although it produces true leaves as a seedling, like most members of this section of the genus the mature plant does not have true leaves but has leaf-like flattened stems called phyllodes.

Depending on climatic conditions, trees may be evergreen or deciduous. In forests it is a straight, slender tree, up to 18 m on forest margins, and in the open it is wider-spreading, sometimes drooping, and in the KwaZulu-Natal bushveld it often grows as a shrub approx. 1.5 m tall. The less water it receives, the shorter it is. It occurs in a variety of habitats, and is usually found in moist soils at forest margins, along rivers and streams, often in riverine fringe thicket, also in ravines and valleys and along dry river beds. The plant has a wide range of traditional uses for food, medicine and other commodities. iIt has several applications in agroforestry as a shade tree, pioneer species etc. It is also grown in various areas in plantations as a timber crop and is grown as an ornamental in gardens, where its fast growth makes it a popular choice for a new garden.",Green,"Fibrous Deep, Rhizome",Late Winter - Fall,Fall - Winter,Medium,Rounded,Fast,Medium,Minor,"Full_Sun, Partial_Shade",10 -- 12,"Wet, Moderate",4.5 - 7.5,"Erosion Control, Insectory, Reclamator, Reclamator, Soil Builder, Wildlife Food, Wildlife Habitat","Biomass, Coppice, Dye, Fiber, Food, Medicine, Medicine, Oil, Wax, Resin or Polish, Soap, Wood"
