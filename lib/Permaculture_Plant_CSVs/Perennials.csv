5398,American Agave (Century Plant),Agave americana,AGAM,Perennial,72,120,30,All Year,"Best in gritty well-drained soils. Tolerant of shallow low-nutrient soils. Propagated by seeds and offsets. Blooms only once and then sets seeds and dies. Monocarpic (blooms only once then dies). Bloom spike can reach 12-25ft (4-7.5m). A. americana is a CAM species with characteristic nocturnal stomatal opening and tissue succulence. These traits that have allow this species to colonize water-stressed habitats such as deserts and dry grasslands. The plant typically lives between 10 and 30 years. Small infestations of A. americana can be controlled by digging out small plants manually. Large plants can be moved by machinery. Care should be taken to dig out the taproot to prevent spread by suckering, and all pieces need to be disposed of properly. Agave americana plants are monocarpic, meaning that a plant lives for many years before flowering and then dies once it has flowered. Plants are slow-growing and take between 10 and 25 years to flower, depending on climatic conditions. Plants, therefore, do not take 100 years before flowering, as one of the common names suggests. Plants produce basal offsets that will eventually replace the plant that flower.

Agave plants are a regular smorgasbord of food, though all parts of the plant except for the sap must be cooked in some manner to make them sweet and destroy their bitter-tasting saponins. Unlike most wild edible plants, when harvesting agave you want to find the biggest, oldest plants as these will have the most sugar. Traditionally the flowers and leaves were boiled or roasted. After removing the leaves the body & root should be slow roasted, often for two days, to release its sugars. The sweet flesh is chewed off the fibrous body/root. Flower stalks are also roasted, but for shorter time as they are smaller. Note that removing the flower stalk will kill the plant. After roasting the food can be dried and stored for later use.

Seeds require a cold moist period. These low-growers have tiny, delicate stems that produce numerous white or pink flowers. While considered by many to be ephemeral, this species will sometimes persist in leaf until very late in the season, and may rebloom sporadically. The root system consists of fibrous roots; the upper roots near the base of a plant are somewhat fleshy and swollen. This wildflower spreads by reseeding itself. Rue Anemone is best planted under deciduous trees. It prefers dappled sunlight during the spring, but tolerates considerable shade later in the year. Moisture levels should be mesic to slightly dry, and the soil should contain loose loam and rotting organic material.

The preference is full sun, mesic to dry conditions, and soil containing loam, rocky material, or sand. The seeds of Hoary Puccoon are notoriously difficult to germinate, and its root system (consisting of a taproot) is not readily divided. As a result, this plant is rarely cultivated.

It is native to dry fields, plains, slopes, grasslands, and open woodlands from Maine to Montana south to Colorado, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Tennessee and North Carolina. It is found in all Canadian provinces plus the Northwest Territories, but is absent from the Yukon and Nunavut Territories. It consists of a rosette of basal leaves that form a mat and can be used as a ground cover in small spaces or rock gardens. It also produces flowers on a short stalk in the spring. These flowerheads resemble compact tufts of white hair. The blooming period occurs from mid- to late spring and lasts about 3 weeks. There is no noticeable floral scent. Field Pussytoes spread by means of horizontal stolons that develop small replicas of the mother plant that root in the ground and form dense colonies. The root system consists of a central taproot.

This plant is typically grown in gardens as a culinary herb or flowering perennial. It was once popularly grown in herb gardens not only for enjoyment of the fragrance and aniseed-taste of its ferny foliage but also for certain medicinal purposes (treatment of stomach complaints and improvement of digestion). It is not commonly found in herb gardens today. Leaves are dark green in summer, turning gold in fall. Tiny white flowers compacted into 2” diameter compound umbels bloom in early spring. Flowers give way to ribbed fruits (to 1” long) which provide ornmental interest in summer and fall. Dark brown, licorice-flavored seeds mature in fall.

The dandelion is so successful at colonising abandoned areas of the garden that no help is really needed to grow it. The plentiful one-seeded fruits are carried on the wind and can travel relatively long distances so neglecting a garden will usually ensure that this plant appears. Removing it is more difficult, as the long, thick taproots will delve down deeply into a border or lawn and even in cracks in paving, making them hard to remove completely.

Dock is from the Old English docce meaning a coarse weedy herb. Because it tends to be a bit smaller than many of the other dock species, it is better able to tolerate regular mowing and so is typically the main dock species found in turf. Under regular mowing, it grows very flat to the ground and has smaller leaves than in a pasture or waste area situation. Within turf, it never really gets an opportunity to set seed as the seed-head gets removed by the mower before it has developed very far (unless of course the turf is seldom mowed).

Carpobrotus Acinaciformis ‘Sally-My-Handsome’ is native to South Africa (mostly around Costal Dunes of Western Cape). As the plant grows you can expect it to reach around 2m (3.2ft) long. The plant grows fast and creates a dense mat of trailing stems that are mostly covered with yellow to green leaves often with red-tinged edges. When the plant flowers you can expect to see pink-violet to dark magenta flowers. Both Carpobrotus edulis and C. acinaciformis, are C3- CAM facultative species.

No rooting hormone or mist unit is required, either plant them where they are intended to grow or directly into a container filled with well-drained potting soil. Seed can be sown in spring, early summer or autumn. Seedlings damp off easily and must be grown in pure sand for best results. High humidity will cause bacterial rot of the leaves. Plants in shady positions or poorly drained sites are often affected by fungal diseases ( Botrytis ). Snails cause leaf damage in damp gardens. Plants in old clumps may die back in the centre. Over-fertilizing will cause wilt and die-back.Mature fruits do not release the seeds for at least 3 years, dispersal depending on frugivorous mammals – see Movement and Dispersal.

It grows vigorously in the fall and will stay green through the winter unless temperatures become very cold, in which case, it dies back temporarily. Vigorous growth resumes in early spring, and flowering occurs from late spring to early summer. At the onset of high summer temperatures, growth stops, and the plant becomes nearly dormant. The plant produces many seeds, but often reproduces by means of rhizomes and tubers. Small segments of rhizome can sprout into new plants or the tuber may be transported to a new area. It can be found in lawns and ornamentals, where it can be harder to control than in lawns. Weed control in ornamentals may require hand-pulling, with careful removal of all the tubers.

Blue-purple, two-lipped flowers appear in late spring to mid-summer in several tiered, whorled, globular clusters in an interrupted terminal spike, with each cluster being subtended by (resting upon) a whorl of fringed bracts. Similar in appearance to the closely related monardas. Lanceolate stem leaves are sessile, lightly-toothed, whitish-downy below and mildly fragrant when crushed. Leaves are usually considered to be lacking in the pungency and quality needed for use as a culinary herb. Small basal leaves and shoots remain green throughout the winter. Susceptible to powdery mildew. Foliage is often nibbled on by insects and plants can become rather tattered and unkempt by late summer.

They do well contained in pots, but need to be repotted every year or two in new compost-rich soil. Place the pot under a slow-dripping tap to assist the mint in remaining moist. To encourage new growth, mint should be cut back often. Mint is easy to multiply by division; the smallest piece of healthy rootstock quickly grows into a new clump with regular water and compost. Cuttings of young actively growing shoots root easily throughout the year. Subspecies: Wissi, Capensis, and Polyadena.

Yields can reach about three pounds per plant in favorable climates, but are usually lower. The tubers are vividly colored, mostly in reds, yellows, and oranges, and often have contrasting eyes. Cooked tubers are somewhat softer than potatoes and have a variety of flavors, from mild to acidic and a bit sweet to starchy. Oca is roughly as tolerant to summer heat as potato; it does best where temperatures don’t exceed 80 degrees too often. Tubers are produced during the short days of fall and are not ready for harvest until mid-November. The crop is propagated by planting tubers. True seeds are produced only under favorable conditions and are used for breeding. Oca typically has less problems with disease than potatoes, although this is not true everywhere.

Tall stems are susceptible to wind damage, often breaking off at the base. If you live in an area that does not freeze, blooms will continue all winter and sometimes all year. The plants die back to the ground after a hard frost, and in mild enough climates will grow back the following spring. Pineapple sage is fairly fast growing, so it can be grown as an annual in colder areas where it will not survive the winter. Grow pineapple sage in full sun in moist, well-drained soil. Plants will wilt if too dry; leaves will begin to curl up when the plant is dry. Keep evenly moist throughout the season to prevent leaves from dropping.

Mentha species are very prone to hybridisation and so the seed cannot be relied on to breed true. Even without hybridisation, seedlings will not be uniform and so the content of medicinal oils etc will vary. When growing plants with a particular aroma it is best to propagate them by division. Division can be easily carried out at almost any time of the year, though it is probably best done in the spring or autumn to allow the plant to establish more quickly. Virtually any part of the root is capable of growing into a new plant. Larger divisions can be planted out direct into their permanent positions. However, for maximum increase it is possible to divide the roots up into sections no more than 3cm long and pot these up in light shade in a cold frame.

These require photoperiods under 14 hr and/or temperatures under 60°F for floral initiation. As the name suggests, these plants generally bear fruit in the spring only, unless grown in areas with cool summer temperatures such as coastal California. 2. Everbearing strawberry plants. These cultivars fruit throughout the growing season provided temperatures are not too high. There are two types of everbearers: A. Long-day. Lengthening days promote more-or-less continuous flowering throughout the summer, provided temperature is not too high. B. Day-neutrals. Photoperiod has no effect on flowering.

The flour can then be used to thicken soups, or made into a porridge flavored with wild berries. Mixed with berries, water and some tallow, the flour can be made into cakes, which when dried, make a durable and nutritious trail food. It flowers in May and June and ripens in June and July.

They have straight white hairs that are quite long and conspicuous. From the center of the rosette emerge several flowering stems that are 2-4' tall. These stems are without leaves and have straight white hairs like the petioles. The root crown is stout and short, dividing into coarse fibrous roots. Small greenish-white flowers that form a loose spike. Foliage resembles a cluster of serrated, upside-down hearts at the ends of the flowering stalks. Flower color is green, but becomes brownish or reddish in sunnier locations. The leaves remain over winter, turning orange or reddish brown in the fall and reverting to green in the following spring. The primary advantage of evergreen leaves is that they give plants a two month head start on photosythesis in the spring and then a two month extension in the fall.","Brown, Green, Red","Fibrous Shallow, Rhizome",Late Spring - Early Summer,Summer,Coarse,Mound,Moderate,Minor,Minor,"Full_Sun, Partial_Shade",2 -- 8,"Moderate, Dry",6.0 - 8.0,"Groundcover, Insectory, Reclamator, Wildlife Food","Dye, Medicine, Medicine"

This reaction liberates the very pungent methyl isothiocyanate that gives capers much of their flavor. An additional component of the plant that gives it a unique flavor is rutin, the same bitter flavonoid glycosides found in Rue (Ruta sp.). Leaf stipules develop a pair of sharp hooked spines at the base of each leaf petiole (the spines have been bred out in some of the cultivated types and are often referred to as var. inermis meaning “unarmed”). Where native, plants grow spontaneously in cracks and crevices of rocks and stone walls.

There is no known population outside the Oorlogskloof Reserve. In the wild, they grow in the humus between cracks in sandstone rocks, in light woodland of evergreen forests. These clivia have very thick roots that will survive under rock slabs.

Thus, especially in warm times of the year, it is usually best to remove most leaves while your cutting is growing its new roots.","White, Yellow","Tap, Short Rhizome",Summer - Late Summer,Summer - Fall,Coarse,Single Stem,Moderate,Medium,Minor,"Full_Sun, Partial_Shade",9 -- 12,,6.0 - 6.5,"Domestic Animal Forage, Insectory, Wildlife Food","Food, Wood"

Crocosmia bulbs should be planted outdoors in spring. They dislike cold soil and may not sprout until the soil is relatively warm. Once the flower clusters are completely spent, cut the stems back to where they meet the foliage and allow the leaves to continue growing. Over time, Crocosmia often form large clumps and the bulbs may become overcrowded. If this happens, flower production may decrease.

Hardneck varieties typically produce a flower stalk, with flowers giving way to a seed cap. Each bulb typically contains 4-10 cloves (bulb is smaller but cloves are larger than those of softneck). Hardneck varieties come in three different types: Rocambole, Poreclain and Purple Stripe. By contrast, softneck garlic plants typically do not produce a flower stalk. They produce bulbs with smaller but more numerous cloves than hardneck garlic plants. Summer harvest of bulbs; inconspicuous flowers that are edible. They produce bulbs with smaller but more numerous cloves than hardneck garlic plants. Each bulb typically contains 12-20 cloves. Softneck plants are also braidable (bulbs can be braided together into attractive chains by weaving the soft grass-like tops together). Softneck garlic varieties are the ones most often commonly sold in supermarkets because they typically have a much longer shelf life than hardnecks.

Allium cepa is a herbaceous, perennial plant (usually grown as an annual or biennial in cultivation) producing 4 - 10 leaves about 30cm long and a flowering scape that can be up to 100cm tall from an underground bulb. The plant divides, forming in time a cluster of plants (Flora of China). This is one of the most cultivated plants in the world, widely grown especially for its edible bulb, but also for its leaves. Propagation: Seed. Early sowings can be made in late winter in a greenhouse to be planted out in late spring. The main sowing is made in early spring or mid spring in an outdoor seedbed, this bed must be very well prepared. A sowing can also be made in an outdoor seedbed in August of winter hardy varieties (the Japanese onions are very popular for this). These overwinter and provide an early crop of onion bulbs in early summer of the following year. Onion sets can be planted in early to mid spring. Sets are produced by sowing seed rather thickly in an outdoor seedbed in late spring or early summer. The soil should not be too rich and the seedlings will not grow very large in their first year.

This Opuntia may have been used as domesticated human food for up to 9,000 years. Spineless opuntias were chosen over the millennia while the crop was developed. Many O. ficus-indica clones are strongly related to O. streptacantha. However, other clones have somewhat different origins and are related to O. tomentosa and O. leucotricha.

It occurs on clay and sandy soils, rocky coasts or in natural swamps and other wetlands, and it is light demanding. It is not entirely dependent on fire or mechanical disturbance to be competitive. The leaves are sticky, hence the name “viscosa”. Dittrichia viscosa is well known for its strong odor. The young stems and leaves are covered with glandular hairs which exude a sticky, strong-smelling oil. Dittrichia viscosa may act as companion plant by enhancing chemical defence of the crop plants through its allelopathic characteristics . It may also act as insectary plant.
