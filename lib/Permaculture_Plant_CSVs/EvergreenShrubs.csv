In contrast to normal agricultural soils, cranberry soil requires no tilling, remains undisturbed over time, and little mixing of sand and organic matter occurs. As a wetland-adapted plant, cranberries are tolerant of flooded soils. However, during the active growing season (generally from March through October), good drainage in the soil is essential to proper root growth and function.

In SA it is distributed across the Provinces of the Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal, Mpumalanga and Limpopo. HABITAT: Forest & on forest margins. Adapts well in tropical & warm temperate climates. The name Rhoicissus is derived from the Greek rhoia, meaning ‘pomegranate’ and kissos, ‘ivy’. Perhaps not the most accurate of names: like ivy, it's a climber, but it has tendrils; & the small fruits, although spherical, do not seem very like that of a pomegranate. The species name rhomboidea is derived from the Latin rhombus, meaning ‘a four-sided geometric figure with all sides equal & the opposite angles are equal’, referring to the diamond-shaped leaves. The species was first described in 1859, treated under Cissus. Propagation: Use primings as stem and tip cuttings.

Common juniper extends southward through New England to the Carolinas and westward through northeastern Illinois, Indiana, northern Ohio, Minnesota, and Nebraska to the western mountains of Washington, California, Arizona, and New Mexico. Common juniper is a native, evergreen shrub or columnar tree. Throughout most of North America, common juniper most often grows as a low, decumbent mat-forming shrub reaching up to 4.9 feet (1.5 m) in height and 7.6 to 13.1 feet (2-4 m) across. In parts of New England common juniper occasionally grows up to 25 feet (7.6 m) in height, and a treelike growth form is reportedly common in Europe. Height at maturity can range from 2 to 50 feet (0.6-15.3 m).

In St. Louis, grow as annual bedding plants or in containers that may be overwintered indoors in bright, cool (40-49°F) locations. Container plants can be trained as standards. L. camara has a wide environmental tolerance and occurs in a variety of habitats. These include wastelands, rainforest edges and beachfronts. It also grows well in disturbed areas such as roads, railways and areas recovering from fire or logging. In its native neo tropical habitat Flowering and fruiting take place throughout the year with a peak during the first two months of the rainy season. In addition to spread by seed, L. camara is able to produce adventitious shoots, especially shallow lateral roots, following mechanical damage. Hence, it is also able to spread and establish dense thickets by vegetative means. The capacity of the species to spread vegetatively and to inhibit both the growth of other vegetation and seed germination, in conjunction with heavy and regular fruiting, is the main reason why L. camara forms long-lasting permanent thickets. In areas where natural fires occur they stimulate thicker regrowth.","Orange, Pink, Purple, White, Yellow","Fibrous Deep, Rhizome",Summer - Early Fall,Fall,Medium,Matlike,Moderate,Minor,Minor,"Full_Sun, Partial_Shade",10 -- 12,"Moderate, Dry",5.5 - 7.0,"Dynamic Accumulator, Erosion Control, Fungicide, Groundcover, Hedge, Herbicide, Insectory, Insectory, Mulch Maker","Aromatics/Fragrance, Biomass, Container Garden, Coppice, Essential Oil, Fiber, Insecticide, Spray, Medicine, Medicine, Medicine, Oil, Wax, Resin or Polish, Ornamental"

Arctostaphylos seeds, especially if not sown fresh, are generally stimulated into germinating by one of two methods. The most effective is fire passing quickly over seeds that are lying dormant in the soil - this breaks down their surface coat allowing them to imbibe moisture when it next rains and then germinate. Alternatively, stomach acids act upon the seed coat when the fruit is eaten by various animals - the seed frequently passes through the gut unharmed and is deposited in a convenient pile of nutrients when the animal defecates - the seed will often still benefit from a period of winter cold before germinating in the spring. Both of these methods can be somewhat reproduced by the gardener - the seed can be placed under some straw which is then set alight - both seeds and ashes should be sown.

It differs greatly from the other species in the subgenus Papeda in having large flowers, and large, very thick seeds. The leaves also differ in having extremely long but rather narrow winged petioles, often exceeding in area the slender, pointed, lanceolate leaf blades. Citrus cavaleriei has long been cultivated in China, especially as a stock for more edible cultivars. An important factor in the hardiness of this species is the ripening of its wood, which is helped by hot summers. When ripening is successful it can survive temperatures below –18 ºC, but around –10 ºC may be about its limit in areas with cooler summers. The Ichang papeda's main claim to fame is its unusual hardiness. With the exception of the Trifoliate orange Citrus trifoliata it is the hardiest citrus plant, tolerating both moderate frost and damp conditions.

The distribution of Salvia africana-lutea extends from the coast of Namaqualand to the Cape Peninsula and eastwards from there to Port Alfred. In its natural state it grows not far from the sea and is often a common constituent of the vegetation on coastal sand dunes. An excellent choice for coastal gardens, as it prefers light, well-drained soil and full sun, tolerates strong winds, and is drought resistant. It's capable of re-sprouting from its rootstock. It recovers from frost damage, but prefers a warm sheltered spot in a frosty area. For more prolific growth, water well and give it plenty of compost/mulch. Prune to keep the plant shapely, but with age, usually after about five years or more, a build-up of wood is inevitable. At this point it is better to start afresh with a young plant. Also called Brown Salvia, it is easily propagated by stem cuttings, or seed sown in spring.

Young plants are planted at the end of spring, and are easily combined with most flowering perennials or shrubs which contrast with its grey foliage, such as Diascia integerrima, Pelargonium citronellum and Orphium frutescens. They also give good contrast with fynbos plants such as Restionaceae, Proteaceae and Erica species. Unpalatable to game and stock. Salvia dentata is best grown in open ground in full sun. It requires well-drained, composted soils. The toothed sage will survive with little water, but responds well to regular watering, especially in summer.

Besides the lost production from its direct effects on pasture, costs have included hand slashing, mechanized clearing and herbicides used in attempts to maintain pastures clear of manuka.
