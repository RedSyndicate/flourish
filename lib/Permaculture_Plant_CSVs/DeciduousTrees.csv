Starts flowering when fairly young. This member of the pea family is both closely related and similar in appearance to the slightly larger yellowwood (Cladrastis). Yellowwood has more attractive flowers and excellent fall color. Amur maackia is planted in urban areas because of its unique appearance and tolerance to both flooding and drought conditions (Meyer). The bark of the tree is described by some as “zombie skin” because of its amber color, peeling texture, and green undertones. Propagation: Pre-soak the seed for 24 hours in hot water and then sow it in a cold frame in the autumn. The seed can also be pre-soaked and sown in late winter in a greenhouse. Variable germination. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter.

It is not found in areas of deep sand, presumably because it is unable to obtain sufficient anchorage and moisture. A. digitata is very sensitive to waterlogging and frost. All A. digitata locations can be described as arid and semi-arid, with not more than a day frost per year. Once established, the seedlings grow well, becoming 2 m tall in 2 years, and 7 m tall in 10 years. The tree then grows slowly but lives long; under favourable conditions some A. digitata may live for more than 1000 years. There is a prehistoric drawing of an A. digitata tree at the National Museums of Kenya. The trunk may even shrink during periods of severe drought.

Transplanting of seedlings is done in rainy season. Seedlings are frost sensitive but have good power of recovery. They are found prone to damping off disease at a tender stage. Propagule Rate and Pre treatment : Alternate days soaking of seeds and drying in cow dung for 15 days hasten seed germination. Seed treatment in concentrated H2SO4 for 5 minutes followed by washing in running water induces 60-65% germination. Intercropping with any short duration crop can be done from early stage of planting till 3-4 years age. Economic yield of seed production takes place after 10 years of plantation.

The fruits are best collected from the tree, since fallen seeds are often damaged by insects or rodents. The optimum period for collection is when the color of the fruits turns brownish green and pulp turns yellow and juicy. The moisture content of seed at this stage is about 20-25 %. The easiest way of collection is to spread a tarpaulin under the tree and collect the fruits by shaking the trees or lopping the branches or plucking the fruits. On an average a full grown tree yields about 28-37 kg of fruits in one season. Plants are dioecious so both a male and female are needed for fruit set. When S. oleosa is employed as a host for lac insects in northern India, trees are inoculated early in the rainy season (June-July) or in January-February. Shoots of 4-10 months old are most suitable for larval settlement. Lac is harvested after about 6 months. Only trees with a fully developed crown produce a good yield of lac.

Cross-pollination leads to increased yields. Insect pollinated. Leaflets are sensitive to light and touch, folding up like mimosas in the dark of night or if disturbed. The carambola is widely grown from seed though viability lasts only a few days. Only plump, fully developed seeds should be planted. In damp peat moss, they will germinate in one week in summer, require 14 to 18 days in winter. The seedlings are transplanted to containers of light sandy loam and held until time to set out. They are very tender and need good care. Seedlings are highly variable. Air-layering has been practiced and advocated. However, root formation is slow and later performance is not wholly satisfactory. Inarching is successful in India, shield-budding in the Philippines and the Forkert method in Java. Trees can be top-worked by bark-grafting, a popular technique in Java. For mass production, side-veneer grafting of mature, purplish wood, onto carambola seedlings gives best results for most workers.

It is not an ash, however, but a member of the citrus family (Rutaceae) and is closely related to the also spiny hardy orange, Poncirus trifoliata. It is most often seen in the wild as an 8-10' tall multi-stemmed shrub. However, it will grow larger and is occasionally seen as a small tree up to 25' tall. Male and female flowers appear on separate trees (dioecious) in axillary clusters (cymes) on old wood. Flowers bloom in spring before the leaves emerge.

A wide range of Fraxinus species have reportedly been infected with this disease, although F. excelsior is one of the most severely affected species. Trees were reported dying back in large numbers in Poland in 1992 are now believed to have been infected with this newly identified pathogen. It has since spread across northern, western and southern Europe, causing widespread damage to ash populations, and infecting an estimated 60–90% of Denmark’s ash trees since 2007. Young infected ash trees often die quickly, whereas older trees tend to resist the pathogen for longer.

Grafting is done in the spring, using the whip- or tongue-graft. If older trees are top worked, it is done by cleft- or bark-grafting. Scion wood is taken from selected cultivars after the leaves have fallen. In Florida and India, the atemoya is usually grafted onto the custard apple or sugar apple. Cherimoya is used as a rootstock in Israel. Atemoya trees in the home landscape are susceptible to trunk injury caused by lawn mowers and weed eaters.

In Colorado, populations are scattered in the mountains [44]. Water birch is the only native birch in Utah, New Mexico, and Arizona. It occurs throughout Utah but is most common along streams connecting mountain and desert regions. Water birch is primarily a riparian species and occurs near waterways or other moist sites such as wet swales, marshes, ravines, bogs, or moist open woods.

It inhabits Woodland Garden Canopies and Riversides. -- Range: Northern N. America - Kansas, Nebraska, and the Rocky Mountains. Box Elder has an irregular form. The trunk often divides near the ground into a few long, spreading, rather crooked limbs, which branch irregularly to support a broad, uneven crown. When growing among other trees, boxelder forms a high, open crown, with the undivided portion of the trunk much longer and usually straighter than that of an open-grown tree. The species is dioecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but only one sex is to be found on any one plant, so both male and female plants must be grown if seed is required). The plant is not self-fertile. Of easy cultivation, it prefers a good moist well-drained soil.

The tree is of low economic value and, unlike other European elms, the timber is not appreciated. This is due to its cross-grained wood making it difficult to process. The quality of firewood is poor as well. The typical habitat of the white elm is riparian deciduous forests, where it tolerates flooding for longer periods. Although it is typically found in moist sites, it can also grow on moderately dry, deep soils. Root suckering may play a role in the regeneration of established stands whereas stool suckering is thought to be poor.

Established trees will usually withstand occasional temperatures down to about 20 degrees F. They are resistant to pests and diseases and are not prone to notable pest problems. The jacaranda is moderately drought-tolerant but requires watering during dry periods. If the tree is not watered deeply enough, it may not produce enough chlorophyll, causing chlorosis. The fruit of the jacaranda is a dry round brown pod that is 1 to 3 inches wide and typically develops in late summer. To harvest the seeds for replanting, pick the seed pods directly from the tree when they are dry. Pods that have fallen to the ground may not contain seeds.

The trees are strong, long-lived, and grow relatively quickly. They potentially grow to a large size and should be planted with this in mind. The species has been successfully grown in urban areas where air pollution, poor drainage, compacted soil, and/or drought are common. Compared to the similar northern red oak (Q. rubra), Shumard oak tolerates a broader range of soil moisture, and its more southern distribution provides stock better suited for that area. Shumard also apparently is little affected by chlorosis, which often is a problem for other oaks in high pH soils. Shumard oak occurs on moist, well-drained loamy soils of stream and river terraces and adjacent ridges and bluffs as well as mesic slopes and poorly drained upland sites, at elevations of 0500 meters. It is intolerant or only weakly tolerant of flooding and does not usually occur on the lowest river bottoms.

They germinate readily in a moist landscape. The attractive, ridged and furrowed bark reveals an orange color within its fissures. The trunk can grow to at least three or four feet in diameter. Turkey Oak should be grown in full sun or partial shade but tolerates almost any soil except wet ones. It grows well on sandy ridges and is salt-tolerant. Surprisingly, this tree is not grown in the trade and is not available. But its extreme drought tolerance, ability to thrive in poor, clay soil and attractive habit make it most worthy of use in urban areas. It might make a good street tree for southern cities.

The creamy bark on mature trees facilitates identification from great distances. It is generally regarded to be the most massive shade tree indigenous to the area of its native range extending from southeastern Europe into western Asia. Tolerates light shade. Prefers rich, humusy, consistently moist soils. Tolerates dryish soils once established. Generally tolerant of most urban pollutants. Anthracnose is a significant disease that can severely damage the foliage and twigs, often precipitating premature leaf drop. Oriental plane tree is less susceptible to anthracnose than American sycamore (P. occidentalis). Canker, leaf spot and powdery mildew may also occur. Insect visitors include borers, scale, Japanese beetles, caterpillars and mites.

Under favourable conditions, trees reach a diameter of 18 cm in 5 years. Average annual wood production has been estimated at 25-30 cubic m/ha per year. Grass growing under the tree canopies does not show a decrease in dry matter content, but the fibre content is lower, and the protein content is significantly increased. A 5-year-old tree can produce 550 kg (1210 lb) of green forage; timber yields of 10–25 m3 /ha/yr (1715–4290 bf/ha/yr) under a 10–15 year rotation. Rain tree has a distinctive, umbrella-shaped crown. The crown is typically broad and domed; the horizontal spread is greater than the height when grown in spacious, open settings. Under plantation conditions, the crown is more vase-shaped. The leaflets are light-sensitive and close together on cloudy days (as well as from dusk to dawn), allowing rain to fall through the canopy to the ground below.

The leaves are diamond-shaped and shiny, with serrated edges; they turn yellow in the fall. This tree produces bright red catkins. Although it grows quickly and is salt- and drought-tolerant, it is susceptible to many diseases and can be short-lived. Black poplar is dioecious, meaning male and female flowers are found on separate trees. Flowers are catkins (male catkins are red and female catkins are yellow-green), and are pollinated by the wind. Female trees have cottony seeds that lead to frequent clean-ups. However, the male trees cause issues of its own with the abundance of pollen.

Remarkably, E. robusta adapts to varied conditions, from equatorial regions with maximum temperatures of about 35 deg. C, to more temperate climates where it can endure frost, provided the frosts are not severe. It grows well in plantations on good sites, but because of its ability to grow on both poorly drained and draughty locations, it is usually planted on adverse sites. It regenerates in areas flooded with fresh water, and its roots appear to be able to penetrate the heavy clays found in these conditions to reach the aerated soils below. The growth habit also helps it to establish on difficult but not necessarily flooded soils in localities widely different from its normal habitat. It can send out aerial roots from its trunk.

Best sited in locations protected from strong winds. Generally tolerant of urban conditions, particularly if well-sited in the landscape. Tolerant of neutral to slightly alkaline soil conditions. White ash is a pioneer species that establishes itself on fertile abandoned fields in several parts of the country. In the Southeast, much of the abandoned agricultural land is incapable of supporting white ash. On such sites, white ash establishes itself only after some site protection and improvement has been accomplished by pines. However, pioneer ash often do not develop into good timber trees unless other hardwoods or pines are also present to provide competition and reduce branchiness.",Purple,"Tap, Long Rhizome",Spring - Late Spring,Summer,Medium,Rounded,Moderate,Major,Major,"Full_Sun, Partial_Shade, Shade",3 -- 9,"Wet, Moderate, Dry",5.0 - 8.0,"Domestic Animal Forage, Reclamator, Wildlife Food, Wildlife Habitat","Aromatics/Fragrance, Fiber, Medicine, Medicine, Ornamental, Wood"

It’s often used in landscaping because when a leaf dies it turns red making the tree colorful most of the time. Seed - pre-soaking in cold water for 24 hours prior to sowing has been reported to improve germination rates. Buried seeds have a better chance of successful germination. The germination rate is quite high for fresh seeds, with reports of 85 - 100% germination, but it declines rapidly when seeds have been stored for some time. Germination needs much moisture, and usually takes 2 - 5 weeks. Usually sown in a nursery seedbed, the seed can also be sown directly in the field when conditions are favorable.

This shrub prefers full or partial sun, wet to moist conditions (although not standing water), and either peaty soil or calcareous sand. It is very winter-hardy. The root system is shallow and woody, sometimes forming clonal offsets from underground runners.

Paper mulberry spreads by means of its 1.5–2.0 cm fruits which are transported significant distances by local wildlife. This also enables it to enter and colonize gaps deep within an undisturbed area. Once established, paper mulberry then spreads from its root system, forming dense thickets which are often thirty feet across. Propagation Seed - no pre-treatment is required.

Bark is very thin, greyish-green, ashy or reddish with a chlorophyll layer beneath the thin outer layer, which peels off in thin, papery flakes. Typically grows on rocky ridges; it does well on neutral soils above gneiss, schist, quartzite, limestone and sandstone. The species has the ability to thrive in the poorest and the shallowest soils where most of its associates remain stunted. Seeds obtained during May-June from selected plus trees. Seeds are sown during July-August and about two months old seedlings are planted in the field at a spacing of 5m x 5m. Thus, about 400 plants per hectare are required for raising plantation.

American chestnut now persists mostly in the form of sprouts from old stumps and root systems. Typically the sprouts grow up and possibly flower and fruit for several years before dying back from the blight. Before blight introduction, mature trees typically reached 50-75’ (occasionally to 100’) tall with globular spreading crowns. C chestnut was perhaps the most widespread and abundant species in the Eastern United States since the last glaciation, with the highest concentration of American chestnut in the Southern Appalachian Mountains.The presence of American chestnut often indicates acidic soils derived from gneiss, metamorphosed sandstone, and sandstone that is deficient in lime and potash.","White, Yellow","Tap, Rhizome",Late Spring - Early Summer,Summer - Fall,Coarse,Rounded,Moderate,Medium,Major,"Full_Sun, Partial_Shade, Shade",5 -- 8,Moderate,4.0 - 8.0,"Domestic Animal Forage, Insectory, Soil Builder, Wildlife Food, Wildlife Food","Dye, Food, Medicine, Wood"
