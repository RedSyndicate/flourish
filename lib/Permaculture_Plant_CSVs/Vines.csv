It roots at the nodes and often forms loose mats. The flowers are borne in axillary, single stalks at the tip of the branchlets. The fruit is a drupe containing eight seeds. Partridgeberry is widely distributed throughout the eastern United States. The stems run along the ground in a vine-like fashion often carpeting an area. The leaves are opposite with a smooth margin and white central vein. White, sometimes pinkish, flowers mature in summer. The sprawling herb produces a shiny, red berry with a tiny dimple and star-shaped marks. It ranges from Newfoundland south to central Florida and from southern Ontario and Minnesota south to eastern Texas. Partridgeberry grows on a variety of sites but generally prefers mildly acidic, well-drained mesic soils. It grows on leached banks, shaded sandstone ledges, and mossy hammocks and bogs. Best grown in organically rich, medium moisture, well-drained soils in part shade to full shade. Tolerates some drought, but best with consistent watering.

The inflorescence is a raceme with up to 10 purple flowers approximately 0.5 to 1.5 inches long. Flowering occurs from May to August with the seeds maturing around one month after pollination. American vetch has a moderate to deeply-branched taproot which reaches a maximum depth of 40 inches. The deep tap root allows for the plant to exhibit characteristics of severe drought tolerance.",Purple,"Tap, Short Rhizome",Late Spring - Early Summer,Summer,Medium,Spreading,Moderate,Minor,Minor,"Full_Sun, Partial_Shade, Shade",3 -- 9,"Moderate, Dry",5.9 - 7.2,"Domestic Animal Forage, Dynamic Accumulator, Erosion Control, Groundcover, Insectory, Nitrogen Fixer, Reclamator, Wildlife Food, Wildlife Food","Fiber, Food, Food, Medicine, Medicine, Medicine, Ornamental, Soap"
1795,Crown Vetch (Axseed),Securigera varia,SEVA,Vine,18,48,6,Summer,"Well adapted legume for non-agricultural uses including steep roadside slopes. Invasive plant that may out compete and choke out other herbaceous and woody plants. Plants are not particularily attractive in spring. There are at least 3 common crownvetch cultivars: 'Penngift', 'Chemung', and 'Emerald'. These cultivars are essentially ecotypes that developed with 20 or more years of natural selection at different sites. Crownvetch reproduces by seed and rhizomes. Rhizome spread and sprouting are important to crownvetch growth and persistence. Crownvetch typically produces seed in its 2nd year of growth, and seeds typically mature 6 to 10 weeks after flower pollination. Crownvetch seedlings are sensitive to cold temperatures, soil acidity, and soil compaction. Seedlings emerging after July will not likely survive the winter.","Lavender, Pink, White","Long Rhizome, Tap",Early Summer - Late Summer,Summer - Fall,Fine,Climbing,Moderate,Minor,Minor,"Full_Sun, Partial_Shade",3 -- 5,Moderate,4.8 - 7.2,"Domestic Animal Forage, Dynamic Accumulator, Erosion Control, Erosion Control, Groundcover, Insecticide, Insectory, Insectory, Mulch Maker, Nitrogen Fixer, Reclamator, Soil Builder, Wildlife Food, Wildlife Habitat","Cut Flower, Medicine, Ornamental"
2716,Silver Lace Vine,Polygonum aubertii,POAU,Vine,25,25,0,Summer,"Also known as Russian vine, Bukhara fleeceflower, Chinese fleecevine, and mile-a-minute. Twining, slender stems with drooping clusters of star-shaped creamy white fragrant flowers. Vines need a support structure upon which to grow unless grown as a sprawling ground cover. This is a somewhat weedy vine that spreads quickly by rhizomes. Best to grow on structures or grounds that are not adjacent to areas where the invasive tendencies of this vine could become a problem.",White,Fibrous Shallow,Summer - Early Fall,,Medium,Vine,Moderate,Minor,Minor,"Full_Sun, Partial_Shade",4 -- 8,"Moderate, Dry",0.0 - 0.0,"Erosion Control, Groundcover, Insectory",Ornamental
