It prefers a soil pH above 6. Barley can withstand moderate droughts and does well on alkaline and saline soils. It is less winter hardy than wheat or rye. Barley is sensitive to rust and disease: it should not be sown in milder climates or too early during autumn. Barley forage can be sown as the sole crop or in mixture with a legume such as vetch, pea, berseem (Trifolium alexandrinum) or Persian clover (Trifolium resupinatum).

It behaves predominantly as a winter annual, and has been described as one of the most winter hardy weeds of winter-sown crops in Germany. In Japan, germination and emergence occurred between mid-November and February, with a peak in December, approximately 40 days after initial germination (Noda et al., 1965). In some years, a second flush of germination was observed in late February or March. This protracted germination periodicity helps G. aparine to escape herbicide treatments. In Canada, flowering begins in late May and is completed by mid-June, with mature fruits present from late June to mid-July (Moore, 1975). In some instances, flowering plants have been collected as late as August and September. In the UK, some emergence was observed in the field as late as April and May (Froud-Williams et al., 1984). Flowers are self-compatible and self-pollinated, each giving rise to two seeds. On average, one plant produces 300-400 seeds. Seeds of G. aparine buried in the soil display cyclical changes in dormancy, they lose dormancy in the autumn and re-acquire it in the spring so that seeds are dormant in the summer months.",White,"Tap, Short Rhizome",Spring - Late Spring,Summer,Fine,Matlike,Fast,Minor,Minor,"Partial_Shade, Shade",2 -- 9,"Wet, Moderate",5.4 - 7.1,"Insectory, Wildlife Food","Fiber, Food, Medicine, Medicine, Soap"

It is suited to grazing in pure stands or in mixtures with warm-season companion grasses such as Bermuda grass (Cynodon dactylon), coloured Guinea grass (Panicum coloratum), Bahia grass (Paspalum notatum) and dallis grass (Paspalum dilatatum), or with other legumes. Subclover can also be cut for hay and silage . It was referred to as the most productive legume for vineyards and orchards where its mat of creeping stems provides good cover against soil erosion during winter. Thanks to its profuse self-regeneration, subclover can be used for land revegetation and as a green manure. Subclover can be cultivated in rainfed and irrigated orchards. Subclover is used for controlling fires in Mediterranean forests (strips to be grazed between forests) or as green winter culture in viticulture or arboriculture to avoid erosion. It can help to reduce soil erosion when combined to vegetable crops.

Widely cultivated as an ornamental plant, especially in S. Europe. It is often used in summer bedding schemes. There are many named varieties, selected for their ornamental value. The stems grow fast but tend to have a weak structure. The inflorescence absorbs water easily and becomes too heavy for weak stems in tall cultivar selections, causing bending or breakage. Staking the plants helps. Regular watering of the root zone is a must as a lack of water will make the leaves appear wilted. A trend in the green industry to address both of these problems in last few decades has been to select shorter members & move to dwarf selections.

A period of cold stratification may help stored seed to germinate. Stored seed, and perhaps also fresh seed, should be pre-soaked for 24 hours in hot water before sowing - but make sure that you do not cook the seed. Any seed that does not swell should be carefully pricked with a needle, taking care not to damage the embryo, and re-soaked for a further 24 hours. Germination can be slow and erratic but is usually within 4 - 9 weeks or more at 13°c if the seed is treated or sown fresh. As soon as it is large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter, planting them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Astragalus boeticus presents several traits that facilitate its adaptation to cultivation. In this respect, it is commonly found in meadows, as a weed in cultivated fields, and in disturbed sites.

However, sixweeks grasses (Vulpia spp.) may die back to and sprout from the root crown when wet weather follows a short-term dry period during the growing season. Rattail sixweeks grass is most important in grasslands, open-canopy forests, woodlands, and shrublands (see Distribution and Occurrence) that are maintained by frequent fire. It is well adapted to short-return-interval grassland fires, which are characterized by flashy fuels and rapid fire fronts that burn through quickly and cause little soil heating and damage to seed. Vulpia myuros is an annual grass, native to much of Europe and parts of Asia, introduced to the USA, Australia and a number of other countries, and reported as invasive in Australia, the western USA and parts of the Pacific. It outcompetes native species in grasslands of the western US and is a significant agricultural weed. It forms dense swards and its shallow roots suppress growth of native grasses and forbs.

Cannabis thrives on rich, fertile, neutral to slightly alkaline, well-drained silt or clay loams with moisture retentive subsoils, it does not grow well on acid, sandy soils. Of the many types of hemp, some are adapted to most vegetated terrains and climates. Cannabis is reported to tolerate an annual precipitation range of 30 to 400cm, an average annual temperature range of 6 to 27C and a pH in the range of 4.5 to 8.2. Different cultivars of the species have been bred for both higher and lower THC (the component used as an euphoric drug) and CBDs (the component used for pain and inflammatory relief). Plants require little cultivation, except for weeding during early stages of growth. Hemp grows rapidly and soon crowds out weeds. After the plants are 20 cm tall, weeding is abandoned.

They either die after setting seed or go dormant during the hot weather of summer and bloom in the fall. Henbit grows best in cool, moist areas. It is primarily a problem in open areas of gardens or in weak, thin lawns. It can be discouraged in lawns by maintaining a dense turf through proper mowing and fertilization, and in shaded lawns by growing grass species more adapted to less sun which will better compete with weeds. Although often classified as an annual plant, this species may overwinter as a seedling or as a seed and become a biennial. Seedlings emerge from moist, cool soil in autumn and early spring. Seedling emergence occurs when the temperature is 5-25°C, optimally 15-20°C, and is inhibited by dry, cool soils.","Pink, Purple","Tap, Rhizome",Spring - Fall,Summer - Fall,Medium,Matlike,Fast,Minor,Minor,"Partial_Shade, Shade",9 -- 11,Moderate,6.0 - 7.0,"Erosion Control, Insectory, Reclamator, Wildlife Food","Food, Medicine"

The plants are globe-shaped and do not get very tall–a foot or two at best. Careful management of the timing of planting and harvest can result in a good deal of dried tea from a few plants.

It is also more resistant than barley or quinoa to low night temperatures. Plants do not like excess humidity. Adult plants are unaffected by night frosts in the growing season, the seed can germinate at a soil temperature of 5c, whilst the plant will flower at 10c and ripen its seed at 15c. The flowers are closed at fertility and so seem to be almost exclusively self-pollinating. Kaniwa is so cold hardy that in the high Andes it serves subsistence farmers as a “safety-net.” When all else fails, kaniwa still provides food. Indeed, it is perhaps more resistant than any other grain crop to a combination of frost, drought, salt, and pests—and few other food plants are as easy to grow or demand such little care.

Another report says that it prefers a light well-drained soil and some shade in the summer. Black mustard is adapted to a wide variety of climatic conditions, it is often grown in the temperate zone though it is mainly suited to tropical areas, and grown chiefly as a rainfed crop in areas of low or moderate rainfall. Black mustard is often cultivated for its edible seed, though it is going out of favour because it rapidly sheds its seeds once they are ripe and this makes it harder to harvest mechanically than the less pungent brown mustard (Brassica juncea). Preferring a moist habitat, in less than ideal conditions the plant will not grow to its full potential. Hot and sunny weather can cause the leaves to wilt.

Serradella seed has been traditionally sown as pod segments, in which the pod itself constitutes three quarters of the pod weight. Podded seed is very hard and little will germinate unless scarified through a dehulling machine. If the pod trash is not cleaned from the seed, it acts as a filler, making planting easier. The rhizobium for serradella does not occur naturally in the soil and has to be introduced with the seed at sowing.
