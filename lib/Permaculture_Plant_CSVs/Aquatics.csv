C. demersum is a cosmopolitan submerged aquatic species that has probably already invaded most of its potential exotic range. It has the advantages of being a perennial surviving well overwinter in deeper water and by growing both by asexual reproduction of broken or complete stems and by sexual reproduction of very many seeds. It has a wide ecological tolerance and grows relatively fast. Disturbance of the water body results in increases in growth through changes in nutrient availability but also in faster dispersal around water bodies allowing greater competition with less vigorous species. In general, C. demersum occurs in quiet or slow flowing, hard calcareous, nutrient-rich or eutrophic waters of streams, ditches ,canals, ponds and lakes as a near free-floating aquatic plant where it may form large masses.
