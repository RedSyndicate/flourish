Succeeds in most soils but prefers an open sunny position in a well-drained moisture retentive soil. Hardy to about -15c. At one time this plant was extensively grown for its edible leaves and stems but it has now fallen into virtual disuse, having been replaced by celery.

Its foliage has a mild lemon or oregano fragrance. Lemon Bee Balm can be distinguished from most Monarda spp. (Bee Balms) in Illinois by its more narrow leaves, which are somewhat downy-pubescent, and by its annual or biennial habit. Known by a number of common names, lemon beebalm is a 1-2 ft., aromatic winter annual with unusual, tuft-like, lavender to pink, whorled flower heads. Each whorl in the elongated spike is subtended by whitish or lavender, leaf-like bracts. HABITAT: Prairie, Plains, Meadows, Pastures, Savannas, Hillsides, Slopes. It is susceptible to powdery mildew. ELEVATION: 4,000–8,500 feet. PROPAGATION: Seeds. Once established, should reseed itself. Seeding rate is 3 pounds/acre. There are approximately 819,000 seeds/pound.

Propagation: Seed - best sown in situ in the autumn. The seed can also be sown in spring. Germination can be erratic, it is best to sow the seed in trays and plant out the young plants before the tap-root develops. Seed requires a minimum temperature of 10°c, but a temperature of 20 - 25°c is optimum. Germination rates can be improved by pre-soaking the seed for 12 hours or by scarification. They germinate best in the light. The autumn sowing should be made as late as possible because any plants with roots more than 3mm in diameter in the spring will quickly run to seed if cold temperatures are followed by daylengths longer than 12½ hours. Greater burdock is recognized by its feltless capitula and the yellow hooked tips of their involucral bracts. Woolly burdock (A. tomentosum; also known as downy burdock ), whose capitulum has a woolly covering, is much more common, as is the slightly smaller lesser burdock (A. minus). Burdocks that grow together easily cross-breed, and part of the greater burdock stand is actually comprised of hybrids between greater and lesser burdock.
