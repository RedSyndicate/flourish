This species is the most common ornamental acacia on the Hawaiian Islands, and has even become naturalized in some locations. It s a fast-growing, relatively short-lived (~40 years) tree. Formosan koa, which is propagated by seed, is commonly grown as a street and shade tree. Acacia confusa grows near subtropical areas at low latitudes, mostly in coastal areas such as Lingnan and Taiwan Island in China. Acacia confusa likes warm and hot climate, also low temperature, like light, also resistance to half shade, drought and poor soil, also resistance to short-term floodings, like acid soil. The tree will usually resprout following a fire, so long as it is not too severe. The fire will also stimulate the germination of seeds, which will grow rapidly to revegetate the burnt-over areas.

Optimal conditions for autumn-olive germination were 16-20 weeks of cold stratification followed by 2 weeks of night/day temperatures of 50/62 degrees Fahrenheit. These conditions resulted in >90% germination. However, cold stratification is not a prerequisite for germination. Fowler and Fowler found 51% of unstratified seeds germinated after 10 weeks of night/day temperatures of 50/62 degrees Fahrenheit (10/20 °C). Jinks and Ciccarese found that >70% of seeds from their ""control"" group germinated after 8 weeks despite receiving no cold temperature treatment.

Plant above ground is hardy to -4F. Root hardy to minus 22 F. Similar to other related plants from its genus, the goumi is an actinorhizal species. This means that it lives in a symbiotic relationship with the actinobacterium Frankia, which is found in the soil around its roots. Goumi benefits from the presence of these bacteria because it fix nitrogen from the air in the ground. The effect enriches the soil and the goumi can grow in poorer soils than normal, which also helps nearby plants. Seeds are viable and can be used to easily propagate the goumi plant. They should be placed in a cold frame immediately after the fruits are ripe. Sometimes, it germinates at the end of winter or start of next spring, although it can take up to one year and a half in some cases. You can speed up the process through two periods of stratification, a warm one of 4 weeks and a cold one of 12 weeks. Once it germinates, the young plant grows very well and it should be immediately pricked into individual pots. After they reach a height of around 15 cm, they can be moved outside.

Pruning is essential in order to keep plants well-maintained, but care must be used to avoid pruning the second-year growth that will bear fruit. It is generally best to prune out old, summer-bearing canes as soon as fruiting is over to encourage new canes.

The grass-shaped stem helps to reduce the total exposed area of the plant, whereas the root is well developed and ramified. The leaves of S. junceum have thick cuticles with a waxy layer and the plant produces oils that reduce evapotranspiration, which also reduces the temperature of the plant’s microenvironment.

The yellow flowers, which appear in spring to early summer, are solitary or arranged in dense groups at the tips of branches. The fruit is a small lance-shaped pod usually containing one or two hard seeds. The basic method of rooibos harvesting has remained largely the same as the process used centuries ago. An environmentally friendly way of harvesting tea is used that involves cutting only the young branches. Once they are cut, they are neatly bound and transported to the process yards. The older branches are left on the tree and the bushes get slightly taller every year. The tea cuttings are chopped very fine and then bruised to ensure that the important chemical reaction which develops the characteristic colour and flavour of the tea can take place. After watering and airing, the tea is left to ""sweat"" in heaps and it at this point that the tea acquires its typical reddish brown colour and develops its",Yellow,Tap,Spring - Early Summer,Spring - Summer,Medium,Upright,Moderate,Medium,Medium,Full_Sun,7 -- 11,"Wet, Dry",5.5 - 6.5,"Dynamic Accumulator, Nitrogen Fixer, Reclamator, Soil Builder, Soil Cultivator","Container Garden, Food, Medicine, Medicine, Medicine, Medicine"

It is a deep rooted, rhizomatous, perennial shrub, with roots that can extend six to seven feet into the ground. The spiny, intricately-branched shrub reaches 1.5 to 4 feet in height. The plant, which is grayish green and hairless, has simple, entire leaves that are alternately arranged. The leaf shape is oval to lance-shaped. The small pea-like flowers are pinkish purple to maroon and are borne on short, spine-tipped branches that arise from the leaf axials. The reddish-brown to tan fruits are found between the seeds, with a short narrow beak at the end Found mainly in deep moist soil, but also in dry, rocky or saline soils. Abundant along river banks, canals and irrigation ditches, sometimes spreading into cultivated fields. Propagation: Seed - pre-soak the seed for 12 hours in warm water and sow early to mid spring in a warm greenhouse. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots - the roots grow very rapidly so a deep pot should be used.

4285,Chaste Tree,Vitex agnus-castus,VIAG,Deciduous Shrub,10,8,36,All Year,"Best grown in loose, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun. Plant in sheltered locations north of USDA Zone 7. In USDA Zones 5 and 6, this shrub often suffers winter dieback or dies to the ground. It is not considered reliably winter hardy throughout USDA Zone 5. Even though plants may die to the ground in Zone 5-6 winters, the roots often survive the winter and push up as much a 4-7' of new growth the following year. Because flowering appears on new growth, winter dieback or pruning back to the ground will not affect flowering. In the St. Louis area, this shrub is often regularly pruned close to the ground in early spring each year in somewhat the same manner as is also usually done with crape myrtles. Vitex agnus-castus, commonly called chaste tree, is typically grown in warm winter climates as a vase-shaped, deciduous shrub (to 10-15' tall) or trained as a single trunk tree to 20' tall. In cold winter areas in USDA Zones 5-6, it is more often grown as a 3-5' tall herbaceous perennial.

This willow can spread aggressively from vegetative offshoots. Standing water is tolerated if it is temporary. A new willow shrub can be cultivated by breaking off a stem and sticking it into moist ground; new leaves will develop at the top while new roots develop below the ground surface. Habitats include shrub swamps, borders of ponds and slow-moving rivers, gravel bars and sandbars, lake shore beaches, marshes, damp swales in prairies, and ditches.
