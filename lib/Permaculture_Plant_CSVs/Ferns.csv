The bright red to maroon stems of young plants are also quite distinctive. This medium-small fern is unique because of the bulblets that form on the underside of its leaves. Aside from this unusual method of asexual reproduction, the Bulblet Fern is similar in appearance to other Cystopteris spp. (Bladder Ferns) and their hybrids. The bulblets will drop from the leaves and grow and produce new plants under favorable conditions. The leaves grow from a rhizome growing at or below the ground.

The common name of this plant is in reference to the cinnamon-colored fibers found near the frond bases. It is easily grown in medium to wet soils in part shade to full shade. Prefers moist, rich, humusy, acidic soils, but adapts to lesser conditions. The root system consists of a crown of fibrous roots, from which spreading rhizomes are occasionally produced. This plant has compact, horizontal rhizome, its growth is vigorous. It may go dormant with dry soil. Both sterile and fertile cinnamon fern fronds expand during a short period in early spring.
