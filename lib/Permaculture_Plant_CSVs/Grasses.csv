Though Arrow Bamboo is considered a ""running bamboo,"" it's one that spreads very slowly and is very easy to control, so much so that we call it a semi-clumper. Arrow Bamboo can be controlled in a small area (a normal city yard) simply by mowing or stepping on the young shoots. Keep in mind that running bamboo only puts up new shoots for a short time each year and, when they are ""shooting,"" the new plants are very fragile and easy to destroy.

Life cycle of clump >50 years. In Tripura, southern Assam and Sylhet, indigenous people have identified two distinct forms of culms known as ‘Sil’ and ‘Nali’ types in which the former is much stronger and harder than the later. The ‘Sil’ culm type is mostly preferred for heavy construction and furniture purposes because relatively short internodal length and distinct swollen supranodal rings up to 14-16 is found in nodal zone than the Nali type. B. balcooa has long flowering cycle of only once during its life time around 55-60 years or even >90 years (Banik, 1985) and the clump dies without seed production. The only way to raise bulk planting materials is by means of vegetative propagation or through tissue culture.

Bambusa tuldoides is a species of bamboo native to Asia that is is widely cultivated as ornamental and hedge plant but also for its culms. It has been introduced elsewhere in Asia outside of its native range, as well as in the Americas and Pacific region. Culms and branches root very readily and often grow to form monospecific stands along riverbanks, low hills, roadsides and disturbed sites. This species is adapted to grow in a wide range of climates and can survive temperatures as low as -7°C. Currently, B. tuldoides is considered an invasive and transformer species in Cuba. It is also included in the Global Compendium of weeds as an “agricultural weed”.

Leaf size and culm density varies in wet versus dry conditions. Each plant produces a number of new stems annually - these stems grow to their maximum height in their first year of growth, subsequent growth in the stem being limited to the production of new side branches and leaves. In the case of some mature tropical species the new stem could be as much as 30 metres tall, with daily increases in height of 30cm or more during their peak growth time. This makes them some of the fastest-growing species in the world. The new rhizomes of seedlings first bend downwards before curving upwards to form their aerial shoots - thus successive shoots are not only larger than the preceding ones but also arise from rhizomes that are deeper in the soil. Early shoots are thin, wiry and grass-like, but as the clump develops the new shoots become progressively more woody and larger.

It is native to Iraq, and is widely grown throughout temperate regions of the world. With two-row barley only the center spikelet is fertile, the lateral ones sterile. There are thousands of cultivated barley landraces and hundreds of cultivars. Cultivars are classified according to several factors: number of rows of grains (2-row and 6-row barley), compactness of spikes, hull adherence (hulled or naked barley), presence or size of awns (awned, awnletted or awnless varieties), growth habit (winter or spring barley) and colour (black, purple or white kernels). Barley is best adapted to rich, well-drained, loamy soils and should not be planted on poor, sandy or wet soils. It prefers a soil pH above 6 but will survive as low as 4.3. It is less winter hardy than wheat or rye. Barley is sensitive to rust and disease: it should not be sown in milder climates or too early during autumn.

Its elevational range is 0-2900 m. Plants are typically erect but may also be decumbent. The roots of sand dropseed are fine, 2/100 of an inch (0.5 mm) or less in diameter, stretching from a short stocky rhizome [35]. These fine roots may stretch laterally up to 10 inches (25 cm) and up to 31 inches (78 cm) down through the soil. At 2 to 3 inches (5-8 cm) below the soil surface, lateral roots branch and rebranch continuously forming a dense, soil binding mat. Sand dropseed is extremely drought tolerant and is adapted to sites receiving 7 to 16 inches annual precipitation. Its fine root system allows sand dropseed to extract water at depths between 0 and 30 cm more effectively than broom snakeweed (Gutierrezia sarothrae)).

Once it is established, and provided it receives enough N fertilizer, Congo grass spreads readily. Congo grass flowers later than signal grass (Schultze-Kraft et al., 1992). It should be cut before first flowering and then at six week intervals. When grazed, Congo grass withstands limited heavy grazing. It gives good early wet season growth for eight weeks after the opening rains. Ruzi grass requires light to loam soils of moderately high fertility (pH 5.0–6.8) and cannot tolerate strongly acid conditions.","Brown, Green",Rhizome,Summer - Late Summer,Summer - Fall,Fine,Creeping,Fast,Minor,Minor,"Full_Sun, Partial_Shade",11 -- 13,"Moderate, Dry",5.0 - 6.8,"Domestic Animal Forage, Domestic Animal Forage, Dynamic Accumulator, Dynamic Accumulator, Erosion Control, Groundcover, Mulch Maker, Reclamator",Biomass

It spreads quickly and is difficult to control. It has been widely introduced in the previous several decades as a potential forage grass and has escaped from cultivation. There are risks of its further introduction, to e.g. tropical America where it would pose a serious threat to agriculture. The species is widespread in Sudanian and Guinean savannahs of Africa though sparse in littoral areas, where it is a common agricultural weed, present on cultivated fields, also managed grasslands as well as extensively grazed savannahs. It is a weed in tropical uplands and croplands following disturbance or forest clearing, but is less common within forests and plantations, performing poorly under dense shade. Where introduced in India and Nepal it is also found on cultivated and pasture lands. The species controlled water loss effectively and has a very strong recovery ability after watering even under severe drought conditions.","Pink, Purple","Fibrous Deep, Rhizome",Summer - Late Fall,Fall - Winter,Fine,Spreading,Fast,Minor,Minor,"Full_Sun, Partial_Shade",10 -- 12,"Moderate, Dry",5.0 - 7.5,"Domestic Animal Forage, Domestic Animal Forage, Erosion Control, Insectory, Mulch Maker, Reclamator, Soil Builder, Toxin Absorber",

Foliage gradually darkens to an attractive burgundy by winter. Tiny reddish-tinged flowers appear in tassel-like inflorescences above the foliage in late summer, gradually turning into creamy white plumes by fall as the seeds mature. Burgundy foliage and creamy white seed plumes persist well into winter providing good winter interest.

Common reed is native to Puerto Rico and occurs as a nonnative in HawaiiWill grow in standing water. Extensive genetics studies on common reed plant material from modern and herbarium samples (dated to the 1850s) collected throughout North America revealed there are 11 native haplotypes and 1 nonnative haplotype. Introduction of the nonnative haplotype probably occurred at 1 or more Atlantic Coast ports early in the 19th century, and because morphological differences between the haplotypes are subtle, the introduction(s) went unnoticed. Range expansion of the nonnative haplotype was likely facilitated by travel way construction during this time period. The nonnative haplotype is dominant along the Atlantic Coast and in the Great Lakes area. In western North America, the nonnative haplotype is becoming common along roadsides and waterways in urban areas, but native types","Rust, White","Long Rhizome, Fibrous Shallow",Late Spring - Summer,Summer - Fall,Fine,Sod Former,Fast,Minor,Minor,"Full_Sun, Partial_Shade",2 -- 9,Wet,4.5 - 8.0,"Erosion Control, Mulch Maker, Mulch Maker, Reclamator, Wildlife Food, Wildlife Habitat, Wildlife Habitat, Wildlife Habitat","Biomass, Dried Flower, Dried Flower, Dye, Dye, Fiber, Fiber, Fiber, Fiber, Food, Food, Food, Food, Food, Medicine, Medicine, Medicine, Oil, Wax, Resin or Polish, Oil, Wax, Resin or Polish, Ornamental"

Spreads quickly, forms dense stand, but is a poor competitor with other perennials such as Reed Canary Grass. Habitats include depressions in floodplain woodlands, flatwoods, soggy thickets, wet black soil prairies, wet dolomite prairies, prairie swales, typical marshes and sandy marshes, typical swamps and sandy swamps, seeps and fens, sedge meadows, and borders of ponds or small lakes. Sometimes Lake Sedge is the dominant sedge in these habitats. It is not uncommon to find this sedge growing in shallow water. Has attractive dark green foliage that has a slight blue tinge when young. The root system is fibrous and long-rhizomatous. This sedge often forms large clonal colonies of plants. The preference is full or partial sun, wet conditions, and soil containing mud, silt, or calcareous sand. This large sedge can spread aggressively by means of its rhizomes. While it can tolerate light shade, this sedge may not produce any spikelets. Seasonal flooding is readily tolerated.","Green, Rust",Long Rhizome,Early Summer - Late Summer,,Medium,Single Stem,Fast,Minor,Minor,Full_Sun,2 -- 7,"Wet, Moderate",5.5 - 6.8,"Erosion Control, Erosion Control, Insectory, Wildlife Food, Wildlife Habitat",Ornamental
