        "Notes": "Alexanders is a biennial herbaceous plant with a thick elongated root. The stems grow up to 150 cm and hollow on fruiting. It has large, pinnatisect, basal leaves, with ovate to subrhombic terminal segments; the caulinar leaves are pinnatisect. The umbels have seven to 22 rays, with black. didymous fruit measuring 5.5 to 7.5 x 4 to 7.5 mm. Alexanders flowers from April to June and propagates well from seed. Succeeds in most soils but prefers an open sunny position in a well-drained moisture retentive soil. Hardy to about -15c. At one time this plant was extensively grown for its edible leaves and stems but it has now fallen into virtual disuse, having been replaced by celery. In Europe wild populations of alexanders grow abundantly in salt-marshes and uncultivated land near the sea. normally in lime soils. It is also found in hedges. woods and on waysides.",

Lemon Bee Balm can be distinguished from most Monarda spp. (Bee Balms) in Illinois by its more narrow leaves, which are somewhat downy-pubescent, and by its annual or biennial habit. Known by a number of common names, lemon beebalm is a 1-2 ft., aromatic winter annual with unusual, tuft-like, lavender to pink, whorled flower heads. Each whorl in the elongated spike is subtended by whitish or lavender, leaf-like bracts. HABITAT: Prairie, Plains, Meadows, Pastures, Savannas, Hillsides, Slopes. It is susceptible to powdery mildew. ELEVATION: 4,000–8,500 feet. PROPAGATION: Seeds. Once established, should reseed itself. Seeding rate is 3 pounds/acre. There are approximately 819,000 seeds/pound. In rich soil with abundant moisture, this wildflower may become excessively tall and topple over.",

        "Notes": "Burdock is cultivated for its edible root in Japan and has a long history of medicinal use. Propagation: Seed - best sown in situ in the autumn. The seed can also be sown in spring. Germination can be erratic, it is best to sow the seed in trays and plant out the young plants before the tap-root develops. Seed requires a minimum temperature of 10°c, but a temperature of 20 - 25°c is optimum. Germination rates can be improved by pre-soaking the seed for 12 hours or by scarification. They germinate best in the light. The autumn sowing should be made as late as possible because any plants with roots more than 3mm in diameter in the spring will quickly run to seed if cold temperatures are followed by daylengths longer than 12½ hours. Greater burdock is recognized by its feltless capitula and the yellow hooked tips of their involucral bracts. Woolly burdock (A. tomentosum; also known as downy burdock ), whose capitulum has a woolly covering, is much more common, as is the slightly smaller lesser burdock (A. minus). Burdocks that grow together easily cross-breed, and part of the greater burdock stand is actually comprised of hybrids between greater and lesser burdock. Reduces the value",

A period of cold stratification may help stored seed to germinate. Stored seed, and perhaps also fresh seed, should be pre-soaked for 24 hours in hot water before sowing - but make sure that you do not cook the seed. Any seed that does not swell should be carefully pricked with a needle, taking care not to damage the embryo, and re-soaked for a further 24 hours. Germination can be slow and erratic but is usually within 4 - 9 weeks or more at 13°c if the seed is treated or sown fresh. As soon as it is large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter, planting them out into their permanent positions in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts.",
