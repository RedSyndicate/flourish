        "Notes": "A. aneura is native to Southwest Queensland in Australia, and is the dominant species of that region. Mulga flowers episodically during the warm season, mostly heavily during fall. The common name, Mulga\" is an Australian Aboriginal word that means dream seed, both the tree and it’s seed are part of their mythology. The canopy can extend to the ground. Typically bottom branches are trimmed to expose the trunk(s) and give the tree an umbrella form. Acacia aneura is unusual in that it has an open flowering cycle. The trees produce small, sulphur yellow, rod shaped flower about 3/4\" long. Tan pods (1\" to 1 1/2\") mature from these flowers and are ultimately dropped. Once this flowering cycle is complete another one begins. Trees may produce 3 to 4 flower cycles per year with the heaviest flowering usually occurring in the spring or following summer rains. The bright yellow flowers in combination with the silver-gray leaves make Acacia aneura a striking accent tree in the landscape.",

In European greenhouses, cuttings of ripe shoots are rooted in sand and raised in a mixture of peat and loam. In warm climates, the tree grows fast and requires little cultural attention. Each fruit is a three-chambered capsule. When ripe, each chamber splits to reveal three shiny seeds, each seed having a white fleshy aril at the base. These fleshy arils are the edible parts of the fruit, but are only edible at certain times of the year, namely, when the fruit is fresh, ripe and just opened. Arils are poisonous when unripe or when overly ripe (as when open and dropped to the ground). Fruiting may occur throughout the year, but mostly occurs from December through May. This tree is widely cultivated and naturalized in the tropics and subtropics.",

In summer, the showy, pink and white, two to three-inch flowers appear at night and sometimes remain open all morning on overcast days. They appear near the branch tips and are followed by a fleshy, light green, poisonous fruit, three inches in diameter. These persistent fruits turn black when ripe and split open, revealing bright red seeds surrounded by a black, resinous material. Habit often beginning as an epiphyte on other trees and forming hanging aerial roots. Clusia plants exhibit Crassulacean Acid Metabolism (CAM), a photosynthetic mechanism which aids in conserving moisture. This type of mechanism is also used by cacti and other succulents.

It has a ‘heavy’ appearance, the trunk appearing quite large relative to the tree. The reddish coloured bark is corky and attractive, similar to Banksia serrata. The leaves are another appealing feature of the tree. The margins are serrated, less coarsely than those of Banksia serrata. The leaves occur alternately along the stem and are narrow-obovate to oblong in shape. They can vary from 3-20cm long and between 5-30mm wide, distinguishing it from the wider-leaved Banksia serrata. Well drained soils are necessary for the cultivation of Banksia aemula to replicate its ‘Wallum’ habitat. All heathland species prefer full sun throughout the day, and if shaded for part of the day will be less robust and produce fewer flowers. Plants like Banksia aemula with a lignotuber or fire tolerant stems tend to be much longer lived than those without them. They can also be heavily pruned and sculptured. Banksias generally remain free of disease; especially if they are grown in full sun with well drained soil.",

Plants are typically multi-stemmed, and the crown is often a dense tangle of branches.

This resin imparts a distinctive, turpentine-like aroma to the plant that is particularly noticeable when a piece is crushed or broken. A well established native cover or plant community is a way to suppress Brazilian peppertree. However, the rapid growth and high germination rates make Brazilian pepper-tree difficult to suppress from a cultural weed management standpoint. Mature trees can tolerate shade, seasonal inundation, drought and even fire, but are sensitive to freezing temperatures, which has limited the expansion of this species into more temperate regions. Two biological control agents are currently approved for use for Brazilian peppertree control in Florida, Pseudophilothrips ichini (Brazilian peppertree thrips) and Calophya latiforceps (Yellow Brazilian peppertree leaf galler).

It is cross-pollinated, but pollination is not required for the fruit to form. The trees are integrated into mixed cropping systems with yams and other root crops, Piper methysticum, bananas and some cash crops, especially black pepper and coffee.

It occurs no farther than 50 to 130 miles (80-210 km) inland. Vast stands occur in the Great Dismal Swamp of Virginia and eastern North Carolina. Atlantic white-cedar grows as an overstory dominant in peaty swamps. Plants are long-lived and can reach 1,000 years of age. However, stands rarely survive more than 200 years. Atlantic white-cedar is readily killed or damaged by fire, often by even low-intensity fires. Propagation: Seed - sow early to mid spring in a seedbed outdoors. The seed is best sown in pots in a frame. Seed can take 18 months to germinate. One month warm then one month cold stratification has produced good results. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a cold frame for their first winter, planting them out in late spring after the last expected frosts.

It is native to the Cascades, Sierras and coastal ranges, usually scattered in mixed conifer forest on western slopes, from Oregon to California, southwestern Nevada and northern Baja California. In the wild, it may grow to 100-150’ and live to 1000+ years. In cultivation, it typically grows shorter to 30-50’ tall. Best grown in deep, moderately fertile, moist but well-drained loams in full sun to part shade. Soils should not be allowed to dry out. Appreciates a location protected from drying winter winds. Tolerates shearing. Although native to western North America, this incense cedar does very well in the East and is surprisingly tolerant of summer heat and humidity. Although small, cones are very distinctive and are commonly described as resembling duckbills when they open to release their seed. Incense-cedar has a well developed root system consisting of widespreading lateral roots and several downward-growing roots. Both lateral roots and taproots branch \"profusely\". Bec",

It is a low maintenance plant that tolerates clay soil, wet sites, black walnut, and air pollution. It grows best in moist, neutral to alkaline, well-drained loams. It does not tolerate dry sites, and exposed windy sites should be avoided. Seedlings develop deep roots in well-drained soil and shallow roots in saturated soil. With age, northern white-cedar develops a widespreading root system which is well adapted to secure water and nutrients from cracks in rocks. Also avoid full shade, or foliage will thin out dramatically. Cultivars are typically globular, pyramidal, columnar to conical in growth form. Northern white-cedar reaches ages in excess of 800 years . Two trees on the Niagara Escarpment in southern Ontario were dated at 935 and 1,032 years Because of its long life span, northern white-cedar is a valuable species for dendroclimatic research.",

In its native habitat, it typically grows in a spreading, open-horizontal form (sometimes referred to as var. horizontalis) that is rarely if ever sold in commerce. Trees commonly sold in commerce as Italian cypress are of the familiar narrow-columnar or fastigiate form that typically grows 40-60’ (less frequently to 80’) tall. This columnar/fastigiate form (sometime referred to as C. s. var. sempervirens, C. s. ‘Stricta’ or Stricta Group), is unknown to the wild, but was the tree originally described by Linneaus as Cupressus sempervirens and is the cypress of classical literature that has been commonly planted in Italian classic gardens since Renaissance times. This columnar/fastigiate form features scale-like dark gray-green leaves on upright branches. After shedding the seeds, the cone persists on the tree for several years because, as with many species of Cupressus, C. sempervirens displays varying levels of serotiny: cones may remain unopened on the tree for many years until a fire induces them to open and subsequently to shed viable seed.",

When used for patios and gardens, its thorns must be taken into account in its placement. With careful pruning, the canopy can be raised to form a patio tree. Its fragrant cream-colored flowers appear in spring and are followed by brown, woody pods 4 to 6 inches long that can remain on the tree for up to a year. These pods create some ground litter, but are easily picked up and can be sued in dry flower arrangements for unique texture and durability. This sun-loving tree prefers well-drained soils, deep, infrequent waterings, and is very drought tolerant. It should be planted only in areas where the winter temperatures do not dip below 15 degrees F, as tip burn and possible die back can occur. Young branches extend in a characteristic zig-zag pattern.

Make a hole in the middle of the pot and insert the cutting 3cm (1 inch) below the leaves, then press the potting mixture around the cutting. Seal the pot into a plastic bag and place it in a warm environment at 24°C (75°F) with indirect sunlight. Check the cutting in 8 weeks to see if it has rooted. New growth indicate that the rooting has occurred. At this moment remove the bag and water the cuttings enough to keep the potting mixture just moist.

        "Notes": "This species is native to the mountains of central and southern Europe, from the Pyrenees north to Normandy, east to the Alps and the Carpathians, and south to southern Italy and northern Serbia, where it integrates with the closely related Bulgarian fir (Abies borisii-regis). It can be found at elevations of 1,000 - 2,100 feet (300 - 1,700 m), mainly over 1,500 feet (500 m), on mountains with annual rainfall of over 30 inches (1,000 mm). Silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) is a large conifer that can be found in central Europe and some parts of Southern and Eastern Europe. It is one of the tallest tree species of the genus Abies in Europe. Growth is very slow in early years, and then rapid as the tree matures. The uppermost part of young trees has a conical shape gradually changing to become a rounded dome as the tree grows older. Silver fir shows a noticeable soil-acidifying ability. This tree is considered an important ecological and functional balancer of European forests and a fundamental species for maintaining high biodiversity in forested ecosystems. Its future distribution is subject of a debate between palaeoecologists and modellers, with contrasting climate-response forecasts.",

It occurs at high altitudes, from elevations of 1,000 to 3,000 feet (300 – 900 m) in the north of the range (rarely down to sea level in the far north), to 8,000 to 12,000 feet (2,400 – 3,650 m) in the south of the range; it is commonly found at and immediately below the tree line. Subalpine Fir is adapted to live most of the year under snow and in cold valleys. It can withstand cold air flowing down from large ice fields. This hardy tree may cling to life for 250 years. This plant has cones that are burgundy, brown, or even black. The cones hang upwards instead of downwards. Subalpine fir is susceptible to windthrow.

Plant in full sun in a well-drained soil and irrigate occasionally to infrequently when in leaf - blooms best in drier winter years and when not irrigated and can be semi-evergreen with early and continuous fall and winter rains. Drought tolerant once established. Young trees a bit more tender but eventually hardy to about 25° F. Place in the full sun for best growth. Trunk is thickened at the base. Bark on young twigs and branches is bright green. Prune to develop and maintain a dominant leader and keep branches smaller than half the trunk diameter by regular pruning. Trees are tolerant of urban conditions and have performed well as street trees. Be sure to allow for expansion of the trunk and root system since trees can grow to be large.

Even if totally killed by some disturbance, many eucalyptus produce subsurface ground shoots from ignotubers. For non-lignotuberous eucalyptus, the ability to seed heavily and produce heavy natural regeneration suggest that this genus has adapted to a constant environment of fire . These adaptations allow this habitat to recover quickly from disturbance, permitting limited succession or development to other habitats. At most,following a fire or some other disturbance, increased growth of the understory usually an annual grassland can be expected until the eucalyptus can regenerate through epicormic shoots and lignotuber sprouting.",

The trees can be told apart by the length of the leaves and structure of the stems, with T. caroliniana having longer leaves and cones as well as a rough appearance. Healthy trees in the right location have few problems. Susceptible to hemlock woolly adelgid. Other insect problems include ambrosia beetle, bagworms, borers, leaf miner, sawfly, and mites. Potential disease problems for plants in the genus Tusga include needle blight (needles turn yellow and die), canker, rusts and rots. Foliage may scorch in very hot weather.

In China it is present at elevations of 3,200 to 10,000 feet (1,000 to 3,500 m) in the following provinces: Anhui, Fujian, southern Gansu, Guangdong, Guangxi, northern Guizhou, western Henan, western Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, southern Shaanxi, Sichuan, Xizang, Yunnan, and Zhejiang. This comprises the southern half of the country with a few populations farther north. It is found primarily in mixed forests near river basins and in mountains and valleys. In Taiwan it is found mainly in Nantou and Taoyuan counties at elevations of 5,500 to 10,000 feet (1,700 to 3,500 m) above sea level in mixed broadleaf forests. It can be found in Taiwans's Yushan National Park and Lalashan Preserve, as well as in China's Hailuogou Glacier Park in Sichuan province. Taiwan hemlock is a large e",

In California it is also locally abundant in the Klamath Mountains. Mountain hemlock commonly occurs as a dominant or codominant in high-elevation alpine or subalpine forests. In western Washington and Oregon, the mountain hemlock zone is the highest forested zone. Mountain hemlock is often codominant with Pacific silver fir (Abies amabilis). Because mountain hemlock is shallow rooted it is very susceptible to windthrow. In the coastal strip of British Columbia and Alaska, wind commonly destroys mountain hemlock by uprooting it. Mountain hemlock is a native, slow-growing, coniferous, evergreen tree usually 75 to 100 feet (23-30 m) tall and 2.5 to 3.5 feet (0.8-1 m) in diameter. However, it takes on a variety of growth forms to adapt to subalpine conditions. Below 4,000 feet (1219 m) in the Coast Ranges, it grows in dense stands reaching diameters of",

Inland it occurs along the western and upper eastern slopes of the Cascade Range in Oregon and Washington and west of the Continental Divide in the northern Rocky Mountains of Montana and Idaho, north to Prince George, British Columbia. Western hemlock commonly occurs as a dominant or codominant on low- to mid-elevation moist sites. Maximum ages are typically over 400 years but less than 500 years. The maximum age recorded is in excess of 700 years. Western hemlock seed appears to germinate well and seedlings grow well on almost all natural seedbeds whether rotten wood, undisturbed bed duff and litter, or bare mineral soil. The principal requirement for adequate development on any seedbed appears to be adequate moisture. For drier situations, mineral soils appear to be best for hemlock seedlings.",

        "Notes": "English holly is an ornamental tree or tall hedge. It has glossy green leaves and thorns. It dislikes high temperatures and high humidity so use only in protected locations. Protect from cold winter winds. You need to plant male and female plants to produce berries that provide color and fall interest. It tolerates air pollution. Prune in the winter as needed to maintain shape. It likes partial shade especially in hot summers and will not tolerate poor drainage. Reproduces mainly by seed, but also spreads vegetatively via suckering and layering. Birds eat the berries and spread the seeds to new areas. Creates deep shade under its canopy. The common holly should be raised from seed. Being slow of germination it is advisable, as with Crataegus, to mix the berries with sand or fine earth in a heap, which should be exposed for a year to all weathers and turned occasionally. This rots the outer covering and allows the two to four nuts or seeds each fruit contains to separate. They arc then sown (soil and seed together) shallowly. The varieties do not come true from seed, and have to be propagated by cuttings or by grafting. Cuttings are best made of thin side twigs about 4 in. long",

These branches are easily severed and replanted. B. citriodora is slightly frost-tender when young but can be grown outside in frosty areas provided it is planted in a sheltered position in semi-shade. The best method of propagation is from tip cuttings taken in March. Roots will develop much more effectively if the bases of the cuttings are dipped in a rooting hormone. Generally grows as a bushy shrub in cultivation. Plants commence flowering when quite young. Tip prune to maintain as a shrub. Makes a useful shade tree and can be used for hedging or screening where the strong lemony scented leaves makes trimming a sensory pleasure. Can be grown in coastal areas.",

It is very tolerant of saline conditions and alkalinity, and occurs naturally in lowland forest on limestone and rocky coral outcrops on the coast, along the edges of mangrove forest and along tidal streams and rivers. It is a shade bearer and can grow under the shade of other trees; it is, however, not a shade demander and grows well even with full overhead light. It is also drought resistant and well adapted to adverse climatic conditions and soil moisture conditions; prolonged drought may however kill seedlings. In its natural habitat, the species tolerates a wide temperature range. Mature trees withstand light frost, waterlogging and tolerate temperatures of up to 50 deg. C. In addition to rain, trees require a dry season of 2-6 months. The lateral spread of roots on this species, about 9 m in 18 years, is greater than most other species; moreover it produces root suckers profusely. Because of these characteristics, pongam is unsuitable for agroforestry and has the potential to become a weed if not managed carefully.",

Exposed stems are usually pale buff or grey brown, grossly ringed by leaf scars. Stems are hollow. Leaves are sword like, 1 to 2 m long and 4 to 7 cm wide, arranged spirally in three rows at the tips of the branches. In fully exposed leaves, the midrib is bent, and the upper third or so of the leaf hangs down, giving Pandanus plants their characteristic drooping appearance.

The branches, especially new growth, may also have thorns. Usually grafted on Trifoliate Orange (Citrus trifoliata) rootstock because its own roots do not allow it to flourish. In late spring, fragrant white flowers bloom singly or in clusters from the leaf axils. The orange fruits are round to oval in shape and small (less than 1\" in diameter). There are many varieties in cultivation that produce larger fruits. Individual plants can reach up to 15' tall and 12' wide. Higher cold tolerance than most citrus. Highly resistant/immune to citrus canker. Can be overwintered indoors in pots in colder climates. The flowers self-pollinate readily. Productive up to 50 years in a good location with proper care.

Naturally distributed from north-eastern Victoria to Townsville and from the coast through to the semi-arid inland, B. populneus inhabits various well-drained soil types, often occurring amongst rocky outcrops of granite or limestone and also thriving on deeper soils in some areas. Propagation is from seed or cutting. Seeds are readily germinated and immersion in warm-hot water then soaking for 12 hours enhances success. Care must be taken to avoid the irritating hairs surrounding the seeds. Cuttings from plants with desirable characteristics may be grafted onto seedling rootstock.

Bay leaves are from Laurus nobilis (True Laurel, Bay Laurel), which also is a member of the family Lauraceae but it is native to the Mediterranean region. The leaves of Umbellularia californica are sometimes used as a bay leaf substitute but they have much stronger flavor. The root system of California-laurel is wide and spreading, although it varies from shallow to deep, depending on the soil and drainage. When established, which may be difficult, it grows in any rich, moist, well-drained soil. California-laurel grows under conditions that range from the cool, humid climate of coastal forests to the hot, dry climates of the chaparral or interior woodlands. Within its range, annual precipitation varies from 13 to 83 in., with 0.7 to 17.0 in. falling from April to September. Temperature extremes are -13 to 118 °F, although a milder climate",

Based on origin, 2 groups are distinguished: the Chinese groups with large, pyriform, deep orange fruit, ripening mid-season to late, which can be kept for 1-2 weeks, and the Japanese group with small, slender, light-coloured fruit, maturing early and having a shorter shelf life. The principle enemies of E. japonica in California are pear-blight (Bacillus amylovorus) and loquat scab (Fusicladium dendriticum var. eriobotrye). In Florida, the flowers are blighted by the anthracnose fungus (Colletotrichum gloesporioides). In California, 4 insects usually attack the tree: the codling moth (Cydia pomonella), the green apple aphis (Aphis pomi), the San Jose scale (Aspidiotus perniciosus), and the Florida wax scale (Ceroplastes floridensis).

It grows in moist to wet forests at elevations ranging from almost sea level to 6,000 feet. Pipturus albidus is a highly variable plant which has in the past been divided into as many as 10 species. It can be a shrub or a small tree and ranges in height from 6 to 20 feet tall. An excellent understory shrub for taller trees in shaded and part sun locations with moderate amounts of water. Red-veined varieties appear to handle full sun in open lowland landscapes than do green-leaved varieties. Māmaki is generally not suited for hot, dry coastal seetings. It does well in urban landscapes with some shading. Māmaki require moist to wet conditions at the roots. Plants are prone to ants, scale, mealy bugs, thrips and aphids. Chinese rose beetles, caterpillars and grasshoppers make holes in the leaves but usually do not affect the overall health of the plant if damage is minimal. Spittle bugs and aphids may attack new growth but are seldom a major problem. Fungal disease can attack and kill young plants.",

Mango trees grow readily from seed. Germination rate and vigor of seedlings are highest when seeds are taken from fruits that are fully ripe, not still firm. Also, the seed should be fresh, not dried. If the seed cannot be planted within a few days after its removal from the fruit, it can be covered with moist earth, sand, or sawdust in a container until it can be planted, or kept in charcoal dust in a dessicator with 50% relative humidity. Seeds stored in the latter manner have shown 80% viability even after 70 days.

It is a highly fire-adapted species, occurring in an area where fires have long been caused by volcanic activity and, since the early Holocene, by humans. Best in deep, moderately fertile, well-drained soils. Generally 20-30ft tall in cultivation. Dioecious. Best in locations with cool summers. Can form large surface roots. Juveniles are conical or pyramidal with sparse, symmetrical, rope-like branches forming an open growth habit. At maturity, the crown broadens into an umbrella-shaped canopy atop a tall straight trunk with few lower branches. Native specimens can live to 1000 or more years. It is usually dioecious, with the male and female cones on separate trees, though occasional individuals bear cones of both sexes. raucaria araucana is a popular garden tree, planted for its unusual",

Betel nut palm is ideally suited for tropical everwet climates (humid tropical lowland, maritime tropical, subtropical wet, tropical wet forest) with high rainfall that is evenly distributed throughout the year. In areas with a seasonal dry period, irrigation must be provided to assure evenly distributed moisture year-round. These palms are unable to withstand extreme temperatures or a wide variance of daily temperatures. They thrive best at low altitudes; above 900 m (2950 ft), flowering and fruit production are adversely affected. Mature fronds are shed after 2 years; betel nut palm is considered a “self-pruning” palm species. Aerial (adventitious) roots are occasionally produced from the base of the trunk. In plantation culture adventitious (“prop”) roots are encouraged by deep-planting seedlings (90 cm [3 ft] below ground level), then gradually adding earth around the base of the palm, inducing root formation at the buried nodes. Considered a self-pruning palm, betel nut palm drops old fronds (ca 2 m [6.6 ft] long) throughout the year as new fronds emerge. Falling fronds may da",

        "Notes": "It is a shade-tolerant species regenerating under the canopy cover. Its leaves are small and coriaceous and the lower side is covered by white hairs. These characteristics are typical of sclerophyllous species, making it possible to reduce transpiration and to improve their resistance to drought. However, holm oak is less adapted to extreme drought in comparison with other evergreen Mediterranean tree species. In the Iberian Peninsula the holm oak woodlands are historically managed as savannah-like ecosystems, with large, isolated trees emerging from a grassland. These formations, known as dehesas in Spain and montados in Portugal, provide trees for shading livestock, firewood from pruning and refuge and breeding sites for a large number of vertebrates, whereas the grassland is used by cows and sheep for milk and meat production, and acorns for feeding pigs. The sustainable and ecological ecosystems are managed by preventing woody plants from invading grasslands. It was introduced to California in 1858, and has now naturalized along the coast from San Diego north to British Columbia. It is quite an important wildlife tree as it tends to form a hollow trunk at a relatively young a",

Quercus floribunda is not a very cold-hardy tree, tolerating temperatures down to around -8°c when dormant. It grows best in areas with hot summers, though it is often found in regions with deep snow in winter. In areas with cooler summers (even if the winters are mild), such as the maritime regions of the temperate zone, it often grows poorly, failing to properly ripen its wood and suffering frost damage over the winter. The seeds take two growing seasons to ripen. Propagation: Seed - it quickly loses viability if it is allowed to dry out. It can be stored moist and cool overwinter but is best sown as soon as it is ripe in an outdoor seed bed, though it must be protected from mice, squirrels etc. Small quantities of seed can be sown in deep pots in a cold frame. Plants produce a deep taproot and need to be planted out into their permanent positions as soon as possible, in fact seed sown in situ will produce the best trees. Trees should not be left in a nursery bed for more than 2 growing seasons without being mo",

In its native range, E. guineensis occurs wild in riverine forests or in freshwater swamps, though may be occasionally found at its ecological extremes from savanna to rainforest, otherwise mostly in tropical dry to tropical wet forest vegetation types. It does not regenerate or grow well in dense natural forests as it is apparently not very competitive with other forest species, and therefore tends to be found where other forest species do not grow well. It is shade intolerant, but needs adequate soil moisture and can tolerate periodic waterlogging.3 years to production when not grown from seed. E. guineensis needs a good moisture supply and open areas as they cannot compete with faster-growing tree species. E. guineensis does not grow under continuous flooding but is tolerant of fluctuating water tables with periods of standing water. Hence, the natural habitats are considered to be swamps, riverbanks and other areas too wet for dicotyledonous trees of the tropical rain forest. Under cultivation, rainfall is often the main limiting factor on production. Major areas of oil-palm cultivation are in the equatorial belt where m",

Dioecious-- There are male trees and there are female trees but only the female trees produce fruit. The trunk surface eventually is bare hardwood with decorative knobby surface. Trees are suckering and growers take advantage of the habit for propagation, using a special spade-like cutting device to gradually separate the suckers from the mother plant allowing roots to form to eliminate the need from growing from seed. This method also insures that the plant will be the same sex as the parent. Usually this method is only done with female trees, since the production of dates is the goal. Dioecious.",

Drimys lanceolata, commonly known as mountain pepper, is a medium sized red-stemmed, dense, evergreen shrub that is native to woodlands and cool temperate rainforests in the southeastern parts of the Commonwealth of Australia (Victoria, New South Wales and Tasmania). In Tasmania, it commonly grows from sea level to alpine regions. This shrub typically matures to 6-10’ tall and to 4-8’ wide over time. Showy red stems are clad with contrasting aromatic, leathery, lanceolate to narrow-elliptic leaves (to 5” long) which are deep glossy green above and pale green beneath. Pale yellow to creamy white flowers bloom in April-May. Male flowers usually have 5-8 petals whereas female flowers usually have 4 petals. Flowers on female plants, if pollinated, are followed by spherical black berries (to 1/3” diameter) which ripen in early fall. Used by Aboriginals as both food and medicine, the plant belongs to the Winteraceae family which",

Common in brushy areas on level uplands, stony hillsides, and lower slopes from Houston and Bryan, Texas, in the east, west to Big Bend in west Texas and south to Nuevo Leon in northeastern Mexico. Very common in central and south Texas. This well-shaped, small tree is valued primarily for its striking trunk and branches, which are a smooth, pale greyish white or whitish grey, peeling off to reveal subtle greys, whites, and pinks beneath. The fruits, borne on female trees, are edible once soft, with a flavor some liken to prunes, and are favorites of many birds and mammals. It is extremely drought-tolerant and disease-resistant and is ideal for small spaces in full sun. The heartwood, found only in very large trunks, is black, like that of the related ebony (Diospyros ebenum), while the sapwood is clear yellow. Several characteristics enable Texas persimmon to survive in semiarid environments. The broad upwardly inclined leaves and smooth bark with low water retention serve to funnel rainwater down the stems. It is likely that Texas persimmon cannot p",

Pinus roxburghii is widespread and common in the north-south oriented outer valleys of the Himalaya and its foothills and often forms pure stands especially on dry, fire-prone slopes. Mature trees are relatively fire resistant; regeneration after destructive fires can be massive and rapid when it acts as a pioneer species. In prolonged dry seasons it may drop most of its leaves. It occurs on a variety of substrates, from deep soil to bare rocks. Its altitudinal range is from 400 m to 2,300 m a.s.l., with the highest growing, scattered individuals at 2,500 m. Pinus roxburghii is restricted to the monsoon belt with summer rains. In its higher altitudinal range this pine species is commonly mixed with Cedrus deodara and Pinus wallichiana, but occurs below the forest zone characterized by species of Abies. Broad-leaved trees (angiosperms) are commonly Quercus incana, Schima wallichii and Rhododendron arboreum. Towards its lower limit angiosperms become more dominant and the pines occur on rocky slopes with a northern or eastern aspect. Recorded across the Himalayas, from Pakistan to NE India, Arunach",

There are outlying pitch pine populations as far west as western Kentucky. Pitch pine is most common on the Atlantic Coastal Plain. There are 2 disjunct pitch pine populations in Canada. Both Canadian populations occur along the St Lawrence River, 1 in extreme southwestern Quebec and the other in extreme southeastern Ontario. The US Geological Survey provides a distributional map of pitch pine. HABITAT TYPES AND PLANT COMMUNITIES: Pitch pine is often dominant in pine barrens vegetation in the northeastern United States. On extremely harsh sites it may represent a climax vegetation type, but most often pitch pine forests are early seral and are replaced by oaks (Quercus spp.) and other hardwoods in the absence of fire. In the Appalachian region, pitch pine is common on ridges with Virginia pine (Pinus virginiana) and",

Susceptible to sweeping winds and salt intolerant. Red pine produces lateral roots with vertical sinker roots that are moderately deep and wide-spreading. It may also produce a taproot extending 0.39 to 10 feet (0.12-3 m) below ground. Lateral roots radiate from the tree in a spoke-like fashion and remain relatively close to the soil surface (4-18 inches (10-45 cm)).",

Scots pine is frequently used in dendrochronology, because it is relatively long lived and often grows in marginal conditions, where small fluctuations in temperature and/or moisture can have a noticeable effect on its growth. It is best to sow the seed in individual pots in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe if this is possible otherwise in late winter. A short stratification of 6 weeks at 4°c can improve the germination of stored seed. Plant seedlings out into their permanent positions as soon as possible and protect them for their first winter or two. Plants have a very sparse root system and the sooner they are planted into their permanent positions the better they will grow. Trees should be planted into their permanent positions when they are quite small, between 30 and 90cm. We actually plant them out when they are about 5 - 10cm tall. So long as they are given a very good weed-excluding mulch they establish very well. Larger trees will check badly and hardly put on any growth for several years. This also badly affects root development an",

It is not a true pine tree. The blue-green foliage color adds to the striking nature of this exotic tree. Branches have prominent leaf scars which encircle the stems. Large brace-roots emerge from the trunk several feet above the ground, helping to support the plant. Trimming a screw pine is tricky because branches don't have dormant buds. If you cut the terminal growing area, the branch will not grow anymore, it will stay a a stump. For this reason, cut the branches you need to cut where they will be the least noticeable.",

        "Notes": "This long-lived pine is adapted to the cold and the dry air of mountainous regions where it forms extensive pure or mixed forests with scattered firs or birches, in areas where other tree species cannot compete. It needs high precipitation throughout the year, including in the summer. It occurs on all soil types, on slopes and scree slopes, in cracks, and even on peat bogs. This species grows as high as the maximum altitudes at which trees can survive, in adverse meteorological conditions and where soil is very scarce. It is associated with high-mountain species like rhododendrons, creeping junipers, bilberries, huckleberries and shrubby rowans. We can find it at altitudes of 800 m to 2700 m.",

Consequently, it can compete in mixed stands where the performance of the other subalpine trees (mainly Picea abies and Larix decidua) is reduced and establish pure stands above their growth limit. Hardy to USDA Zone 1 — cold hardiness limit below -50°F (-45.6°C), which makes it one of the most cold-hardy trees known.",

Called Ooray by the original inhabitants who relished it, it was widely used as a jam fruit by the first European settlers and today it is having a resurgence of interest as a commercial crop for the production of jams, a very good, full-flavoured, dry, red wine, icecream flavouring and sauces. Flowers are small, pink and borne on the stem either singly or on short panicles and occur from September to November. In the rainforest it is a slender tree that can grow up to 10 metres tall, but in a more open position it tends to be more spreading and only 4 - 5 metres tall.",

A germination rate of only a little over 10% can be expected, with the seed sprouting within 40 - 50 days. The seeds, however, loose viability soon and therefore should be planted within 20 days of extraction. Eugenia candolleana seeds regenerate roots and form seedlings even with reduction in their reserves, also maintaining the capacity of germinating successive times and producing seedlings, even when the first seedlings produced are lost. These characteristics may be related to adaptations of the species against predation and may also be considered an ecological strategy as a means of propagation of these seeds.",

Rauvolfia caffra occurs at an altitude from 0 to about 1500 m on sandy and loamy soils. It is usually found along wooded streams, on river banks, at margins of evergreen forest and in swamp forest where it can reach up to 30 m in height.

Native range habitats include estuarine floodplains, salt marshes, estuarine floodplains, saline swamp flats, sand dunes and the edges of mangroves. C. glauca has been introduced to many countries as a timber, fuel and fodder tree, and for soil conservation. It was introduced to Florida, USA before 1924 and planted extensively for shelter and amenity.",

The soursop is usually grown from seeds. They should be sown in flats or containers and kept moist and shaded. Germination takes from 15 to 30 days. Selected types can be reproduced by cuttings or by shield-budding. Soursop seedlings are generally the best stock for propagation, though grafting onto custard apple (Annona reticulata), the mountain soursop (A. montana), or pond apple (A. glabra), is usually successful. The pond apple has a dwarfing effect. Grafts on sugar apple (A. squamosa) and cherimoya (A. cherimola) do not live for long, despite the fact that the soursop is a satisfactory rootstock for sugar apple in Ceylon and India. A. muricata has also been used in agriculture as an intercrop species. Being a small and early-bearing tree, the soursop may be planted as an intercrop between larger fruit trees such as mango, avocado, and santol. When the main crop requires the space, the soursop trees are grubbed out.",

Use as an eye-catching center of attention for the far corners of your garden or in a central island. ‘Golden’ will become a large tree with age. Best color in full sun but may need some protection in warmer summer climates. This is a relatively low maintenance shrub. When pruning is necessary, it is recommended to only trim back the new growth of the current season, other than to remove any dieback. It has no significant negative characteristics. Golden Black Spruce will grow to be about 10 feet tall at maturity, with a spread of 8 feet. It tends to fill out right to the ground and therefore doesn't necessarily require facer plants in front, and is suitable for planting under power lines. It grows at a slow rate, and under ideal conditions can be expected to live for 50 years or more. This shrub does best in full sun to partial shade. It is quite adaptable, prefering to grow in average to wet conditions, and will even tolerate some standing water. It is not particular as to soil type or pH. It is quite intolerant of urban polluti",

It produces high-quality timber and its long fibers make it important for the pulp and paper industry. The species also has high ecological importance, being a key species in northern Europe. Largest and fastest growing spruce. Tree thins as it ages. Best in rich well-drained soil. Plants have a very shallow root system, which helps them to succeed in soils with a high water table. Propagation: Seed - tratification will probably improve germination so sow fresh seed in the autumn in a cold frame if possible. Sow stored seed as early in the year as possible in a cold frame. A position in light shade is probably best. Seed should not be allowed to dry out and should be stored in a cool place. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the greenhouse or cold frame for their first winter. They can be planted out into their permanent positions in early summer of the following year, or be placed in an outdoor nursery bed for a year or so to increase in size. They might need protection from spring frosts. Cuttings of semi-ripe terminal shoots, 5 - 8c",

It grows best on well-drained soils but occurs on a wide range of land forms and soil types, with many different associates, in various regional contexts. Monoecious. Needle rust, canker, yellow headed spruce sawfly are problems. Not tolerate of atmospheric pollution. Seed production begins after appx. 20 years.

There are apparently no named cultivars, but there are local preferences according to fruit color. Red fruits are chosen for the fresh fruit markets because of their appealing color. The dark-red strain (called \"black\") now leading in commercial plantings in New Zealand was obtained by selection around 1920 as a variation from the yellow and purple types grown up to that time. Yellow fruits are considered best for preserving because of their superior flavor.",

It is indigenous to tropical Africa and exotic to Asia and Central America. India and Thailand are the major tamarind world producers, generating 300 000 and 140 000 tons annually, respectively. There are two main types of tamarind: sour (the most common) and sweet (mostly comes from Thailand). Tamarind can be eaten fresh (ripe or unripe) and it can be consumed processed into different products. In addition to the use of tamarind fruit in food it has many uses in the pharmacological industry and folk medicine. The ripe tamarind pods are susceptible to different pest and diseases, especially when grown in a big plantation. Plant has a deep tap root with extensive laterals.

It is mainly found growing in sandy and stony soils, but also occurs in red loams. Where golden wattle (Acacia pycnantha) has become naturalised beyond its native range in Australia, it is most frequently found growing along roadsides and in nearby woodlands. In Tasmania it grows in sandy coastal sites and in drier areas in the north-east of the state. In South Africa it grows in coastal and highland regions, and is most commonly found in fynbos shrublands, along waterways, and on roadsides. It is adaptable to a variety of soil types and can be grown in near-coastal to inland semi-arid areas. It is somewhat sensitive to frost. Fast growth rate, but rather short lived. Grows in sand or loam, in Eucalyptus forest or woodland, open scrub and heath.",

In areas where it has become naturalized, Sydney green wattle (Acacia decurrens) is generally found on roadsides, along creeklines and in waste areas. It also grows in disturbed sites in nearby bushland and open woodlands. Strong, shallow lateral roots are developed. A relatively short-lived species which declines in vigor after 10–15 years.

An attractive ornamental species with dark green foliage and bright yellow flowers; does best in the higher rainfall areas. The var. sophorae is recommended for planting as a low windbreak and sand-binder in coastal areas. Both have a fast growth rate. The plant is a shrubby tree that can form thickets that may be problematic. In terms of changes in fire regimes, the presence of A. longifolia (especially thickets) increases the risk and intensity of fires. Though the seeds are not adapted for long-distance dispersal, they are plentiful and have some dormancy that allows the plant to form massive seedbanks, making long-term control difficult unless early eradication is possible. The long-lived seeds of this species are stimulated to germinate by fire and very dense populations can follow fires, particularly where the indigenous vegetation has been removed or significantly disturbed.",
