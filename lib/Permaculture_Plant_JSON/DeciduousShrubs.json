        "Notes": "This plant is weedy. We do not recommend planting it in Hawaii. This species is the most common ornamental acacia on the Hawaiian Islands, and has even become naturalized in some locations. It s a fast-growing, relatively short-lived (~40 years) tree. Formosan koa, which is propagated by seed, is commonly grown as a street and shade tree. Acacia confusa grows near subtropical areas at low latitudes, mostly in coastal areas such as Lingnan and Taiwan Island in China. Acacia confusa likes warm and hot climate, also low temperature, like light, also resistance to half shade, drought and poor soil, also resistance to short-term floodings, like acid soil. The tree will usually resprout following a fire, so long as it is not too severe. The fire will also stimulate the germination of seeds, which will grow rapidly to revegetate the burnt-over areas. The growth speed of Acacia Confusa is very fast and the adaptability is very strong. It can grow normally in a variety of environments.",

HABITAT: Marl slopes, in degraded oak forests. Genetically it groups with other scrubby almonds from the region. Habitat. On rocky slopes with limestone or metamorphic ricks, in Astragalus zones or open degraded forest. This species is poorly known, and rare in distribution. It superficially resembles Prunus lycioides, however, it differs by having a campanulate hypanthium and lackingthorns, even though it looks thorny because of its rigid branchelets. Based on morphology it was thought to yield Prunus × pabotii when crossed with Prunus haussknechtii. The specific epithet, carduchorum, means \"of the Carduchi, the wild tribesman of Kurdistan who so severely harried Xenophon and the Ten Thousand\". Thornless. Only P. longispinosa and P. carduchorum coexist at the same habitat and overlap at their area of distribution.",

Optimal conditions for autumn-olive germination were 16-20 weeks of cold stratification followed by 2 weeks of night/day temperatures of 50/62 degrees Fahrenheit. These conditions resulted in >90% germination. However, cold stratification is not a prerequisite for germination. Fowler and Fowler found 51% of unstratified seeds germinated after 10 weeks of night/day temperatures of 50/62 degrees Fahrenheit (10/20 °C). Jinks and Ciccarese found that >70% of seeds from their \"control\" group germinated after 8 weeks despite receiving no cold temperature treatment.

Its preferred habitat has also been described as a rocky woods, as rocky bluffs, creek banks and roadsides, as dry woodlands and sandstone cliffs, or as “woods or glades, on rocky slopes and near rivers. Through most of its range it is considered to be a piedmont or mountain species. According to the Nature Conservancy, American barberry was formerly found in fire-maintained habitats which kept the canopy open, i.e., it was an inhabitant of savannas and open woodlands, and fire suppression has significantly restricted its habitat to sites with shallow soil (such as glades and cliffs) or areas with mowing or other canopy-clearing activities (such as powerline corridors, railroad/road rights-of-way and riverbanks).

        "Notes": "Common barberry is a deciduous shrub that may reach 10 feet (3 m) tall. Shrubs often have 20 to 30 erect, widely spreading stems that droop at the ends, producing an arching form. Simple or 3-pronged thorns occur at stem nodes. Thorns measure 1 to 2 cm long [35]. Older stems have gray shredding bark, and individual stems may live up to 30 years. Common barberry root and rhizome growth is often extensive. Surrounding the common barberry root crown is a \"thick mass of fibrous roots\". Large lateral roots occur several inches to more than a foot under ground. Lateral roots may be 1 to 2 inches (2.5-5 cm) in diameter near the root crown and extend 10 to 15 feet (3-4.6 m) from the root crown [86]. Common barberry root growth varies with site conditions. Shrubs in sandy, loose-textured soils produced long lateral roots. Shrubs growing on gentle slopes with deep loam soils did not produce long tap roots. Rhizomes produced from the root crown typically grow a few inches below ground but may penetrate 2 to 3 feet (0.6-1 m). Rhizomes do not generally grow roots until aerial shoots emerge, at which time a mass of fibrous roots is produced at the point of emergence.",

Seed from over-ripe fruit will take longer to germinate, whilst stored seed may require cold stratification and should be sown in a cold frame as early in the year as possible. The seedlings are subject to damping off, so should be kept well ventilated. When the seedlings are large enough to handle, prick them out into individual pots and grow them on in a cold frame. If growth is sufficient, it can be possible to plant them out into their permanent positions in the autumn, but generally it is best to leave them in the cold frame for the winter and plant them out in late spring or early summer of the following year.

Pruning back to the ground may be advisable every few years. Drought tolerant; prune off oldest stems in late winter or immediately after flowering. It blooms on old wood so hard pruning in the winter will reduce blooms the following spring but ultimately will make for a more attractive plant. Produces best leaf color in the filtered shade. Easily grown in average, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun. Foliage of this cultivar reportedly produces best color in sun-filtered part shade locations. Prune out dead wood as needed. Shrub stems tend to become dense and overgrown after several years, in which case thinning stems or cutting back all stems to the ground may be advisable. Hard prunings to the ground may be performed in late winter or immediately after flowering. Plants bloom on old wood, so hard pruning in late winter will result in loss of bloom for the season, but plants stems will grow taller during the season.",

Seeds of red huckleberry require no special treatment for germination to occur. Seeds are readily dispersed by many birds and mammals. The digestive processes of animals may promote germination. Most huckleberries (Vaccinium spp.) require acidic soils and can grow on infertile sites which have relatively small amounts of many essential elements. Red huckleberry commonly grows on nitrogen-poor soils. Soils may be very nutrient poor to nutrient rich but are often characterized by ccumulations of duff and humus.",

In North America, Betula nana subsp. exilis is native throughout Alaska and across northern Canada to Baffin Island, Labrador, and Greenland. In Alaska, it occurs along the coast and in interior mountains from the northern part of southeastern Alaska to the western end of the Alaska Peninsula and the Bering Sea, and north to the Arctic coast. Dwarf birch is characteristic of low, open, mixed-shrub and tussock tundra communities. It is also found in black spruce (Picea mariana) and white spruce (P. glauca) communities including black spruce-birch (Betula spp.), the most widespread ecosystem type in Alaska. It occupies a wide variety of sites, ranging from rocky arctic and alpine tundra to deep, organic soils. Dwarf birch occurs on moist, acidic, and nutrient-poor sites including muskegs, bogs, and the understory of black and white spruce taiga communities. It is also found on well-drained, upland sites including moraines, steep banks, and dry, rocky slopes.

Roots are winter hardy to USDA Zone 5, but top growth is only reliably winter hardy to USDA Zone 7. Thus, stems will often die to the ground in the cold winters of Zones 5 and 6, with roots surviving to push up new stems in spring. Many gardeners in Zones 5 and 6 simply assume stems will be damaged in winter and automatically prune back hard all stems each year in early spring. Moreover, even in warm winter climates where the stems usually survive winter, gardeners still frequently prune the plants back hard in early spring to promote vigorous new stem growth. Flowering is unaffected by spring pruning because plants bloom on new growth.",

In New England, many plants produce flowers with double corollas. This 6 to 10 foot (3.5 m) tall shrub readily suckers and forms thickets. Best grown in organically rich, medium moisture, well-drained loams in full sun. It is a vase-shaped, dense, suckering shrub that typically grows to 6-10’ tall. Long arching canes are heavily thorned. Best flowering and disease resistance occur in full sun. Water deeply and regularly (mornings are best). Avoid overhead watering. Good air circulation promotes vigorous and healthy growth and helps control foliar diseases. Summer mulch helps retain moisture, keeps roots cool and discourages weeds. Remove and destroy diseased leaves from plants, as practicable, and clean up and destroy dead leaves from the ground around the plants both during the growing season and as part of a thorough cleanup during winter (dormant season).

POLLINATORS: Insects. - The plant’s insignificant greenish-yellow flowers produce berries that remain green for several months, eventually turning brown or black. The berries are harvested, dried naturally, and then powdered. Buckthorn species, especially sea buckthorn, were used in medicine since the 7th century BCE. In the 17th century buckthorn was used as a purgative in England, being the only native plant used for this. Its use in the production of pigments dates back at least to the Iron Age, with archaeological samples from that period having been discovered in Finland. This species of buckthorn, one of 22 in Turkey, was cultivated in the 20th century. There were plantations of buckthorn near Kayseri, Tokat, Nevsehir, Nigde, Ankara, Maras, & Konya. Thorny.",

Propagation by Seed: Buffaloberry seeds should be harvested in the autumn and sown immediately in a cold frame. The seeds must not be allowed to dry out. Seeds have a hard seed coat and scarification with sulfuric acid for twenty to thirty minutes followed by two to three months of cold stratification will help the embryo to develop. Place the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle. If sufficient growth is made by the summer, it is possible to plant them out, otherwise grow them in a cold frame for the first winter and out plant the following spring or early summer.",

This allows for the shrub to be planted almost anywhere in a garden. The shrub will be under 4 feet at maturity, and is low maintenance to keep beautiful and healthy. There is no need to water this shrub, as it can tolerate dry conditions. The dwarf bush honeysuckle can also tolerate temperatures of -23 degrees F, allowing it to withstand the coldest Minnesota Winter days. The shrub is also very fire resistant, for its deep roots regenerate well after fires. It prefers slightly acidic, dry soils.",

Similar to other related plants from its genus, the goumi is an actinorhizal species. This means that it lives in a symbiotic relationship with the actinobacterium Frankia, which is found in the soil around its roots. Goumi benefits from the presence of these bacteria because it fix nitrogen from the air in the ground. The effect enriches the soil and the goumi can grow in poorer soils than normal, which also helps nearby plants. Seeds are viable and can be used to easily propagate the goumi plant. They should be placed in a cold frame immediately after the fruits are ripe. Sometimes, it germinates at the end of winter or start of next spring, although it can take up to one year and a half in some cases. You can speed up the process through two periods of stratification, a warm one of 4 weeks and a cold one of 12 weeks. Once it germinates, the young plant grows very well and it should be immediately pricked into individual pots. After they reach a height of around 15 cm, they can be moved outside.

Asia - Turkey, Armenia, Georgia, Dagestan, Iran - HABITAT: A scrubby plant, it tends to grow on dry rocky limestone cliffs. Woodland Garden Sunny Edge; Dappled Shade. - POLLINATED by insects. Requires a well-drained moisture retentive soil. Thrives in a loamy soil. Prefers some chalk in the soil but apt to become chlorotic if too much is present. PROPAGATION: Seeds, cuttings, layering in spring. Hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs). This species is closely related to Prunus prostrata. Plants often adopt a prostrate habit of growth. Most members of this genus are shallow-rooted and will produce suckers if the roots are damaged. Sometimes confused with P. tenella, it is easily distinguished from that and most other species by the close white felt on the undersurface of the willow-like leaves.",

        "Notes": "Known as black chokeberry, this deciduous shrub from the Rosaceae family spreads freely and suckers profusely. The top is often rounded and upright; it tends to become leggy with age. The fruit is edible though very astringent and is produced from 5-6 flowered clusters that bloom in late spring. The leaves turn red in the fall and will drop for winter. Black chokeberry is native to the Great Lakes region and the Northeastern U.S., with a southerly extension into the higher elevations of the Appalachian Mountains. Can be used as a shrub in borders or in more open wooded gardens. This plant does well in full sun and partial shade and tolerates a wide variety of soil types including wet boggy soils. The common name, Chokeberry, references its tart and bitter berries. They are edible but are so astringent they may cause choking. Control of invading weeds and grasses is important. Shallow cultivation works best. Cultivation can also be used to stop the spread of shoots and suckers, if that is a concern. Chokeberry seeds have an internal dormancy that can be overcome by being stratified in moist peat for three months between 33°F and 41°F.",

This species has been investigated for medicinal anti bacterial and anti viral properties and is used in currant fruit breeding programs to confer resistance to anthracnose, powdery mildew and currant stem borer. Propagation with cuttings has been successful with soft wood in spring, semi-hard wood in summer and hard wood collected during the dormant season. Rooting may improve by including a ‘heel’ of older wood and using bottom heat, mist, or rooting hormone. Provide supplemental water during the first and perhaps second season but allow soil to dry 3-4 in. down between irrigations and do not provide water after mid to late summer when leaves naturally begin to fall.

Can be propagated with softwood and hardwood cuttings. Primary flowering occurs in May/June. Fruit capsules persist over winter. Grows best on well-drained sites. Plants in zone 5 and 6 may show some winter damage. Plants may be successfully propagated by both softwood and hardwood cuttings. Desert willow primarily occupies dry washes, intermittent streams and other water courses, and moist canyons in deserts and mountain foothills. These sites generally have underground water available year-round. Plants can withstand seasonal flooding quite well, and often occupy the middle of drainage channels, sometimes covering broad expanses in wash areas. Desert willow sometimes invades freshly deposited channel sediments following seasonal water runoff.As plants develop they may trap sediments, leading to the formation of islands within the channel. Desert willow is considered to be unpalatable to livestock and low in palatability to wildlife.The presence of cyanogenic glycosides may account for its low palatability",

Whenever possible, genistas should be raised from seed, as plants so obtained are usually healthier and longer-lived than cuttings. Plants do not usually resprout well if cut back into old wood, older plants can be best kept more compact by lightly cutting back the young growth after flowering. The taller species are all improved by shortening back several times in the young state in order to induce a bushy habit. Propagation: The seed requires a period of cold stratification and is best sown autumn in a cold frame. Pre-soak stored seed for 24 hours in warm water and sow late winter in a cold frame.

It is a deciduous shrub which is not all that \"compact\" since it typically grows in a mound to 10' tall with a slightly larger spread, though it can easily be kept shorter by pruning. The corky ridges are absent or very reduced in size on the stems of 'Compactus'. For a truly compact burning bush, see Euonymus alatus 'Rudy Haag' which typically grows from 3-5' tall.The species Euonymus alatus is naturalized across the Eastern United States. \"‘Compactus’ is recognized as the main source of invasive burning bush plants.\"",

Like the poinsettia, to which it is related, the “flower” in little Christmas flower are actually bracts. Once the bracts have all dropped, you can prune the shrub which can grow up to 10 feet until August, but not after that, or you’ll have no blooming the coming season. Wear gloves when pruning; the milky sap can be irritating. Native to Mexico, little Christmas flower is best for zones 10a-11. It grows best in full sun and well-drained soil. Avoid planting it under street lights, as it needs darkness to bloom just like its poinsettia cousins.",

It is a tough, easily established, low-maintenance plant that prefers full sun and dry, poor soils; if it's fertilized or over-watered, it will produce leggy, weak growth. It may be pruned lightly to control its shape or promote new growth in the spring. Its only requirements are full sun and good drainage.

The species is monoecious (individual flowers are either male or female, but both sexes can be found on the same plant) sexually mature in 2 to 3 years. FRUIT: The fruit is a small ovoid nut, olive-brown, enclosed in a burr-like cluster of bracts. POLLINATION: Sweet fern flowers are small, inconspicuous staminate catkins, wind-pollinated, & shed large amounts of pollen. PROPAGATION: Seeds, Root Cuttings, Layering.

It appears to thrive best in deeper soils. Throughout its range C. monogyna grows in several types of open forests and thickets, and in Central Europe, it forms its own plant community Pruno-Crataegetum, being a successional stage of vegetation leading to natural oak-hornbeam forests (Querco-Carpinetum sensu lato)",

It may be frequent to dominant on shrublands in postfire and other early disturbance succession, however. California hazelnut is a 13- to 49-foot (4-15 m)-tall shrub or small tree. It typically has several trunks. Twigs are slender and may grow in a zigzag pattern. Male catkins measure 0.2 to 0.3 × 1.6 to 2.4 inches (0.5-0.8 × 4-6 cm). Nuts are in clusters of 2 to 4, with the involucral beak less than 2 times the length of the nuts. California hazelnut is usually not rhizomatous. California hazelnut sprouts from the root crown.",

Produces red female flowers and yellowish-brown male catkins on the same plant (but it is not self-fertile). Should be planted in multiples (2 or 3) to ensure cross-pollination. The woody root system is shallow and branching; it is also strongly rhizomatous, forming vegetative offsets. As a result, colonies of shrubs are often formed. The underground roots and rhizomes can survive low- to moderate-severity fires when the humus is moist. They are relatively shallow, however, and are vulnerable to fire when the humus is dry and combustible. The large, woody rhizomes are 4 to 6 inches (10-15 cm) below the surface. Rhizomes give rise to new shoots 1 to 2 feet (30-60 cm) from the parent plant.",

Although unstratified seed germinated more rapidly if passed through bird guts, this effect was not detected with stratified seed. Apparently avian frugivory has some positive effect on Tatarian honeysuckle seeds with seedcoat dormancy, while simultaneously, cold stratification is effective for breaking internal dormancy. Tatarian honeysuckle occurs on a wide variety of soil types in central Asia. According to It grows in medium-fertility, acid, clayey, loamy, and sandy soils, and tolerates moderately well-drained soil. Tatarian honeysuckle grows on peat and muck soils. It is present, though not common, on poorly-drained shrub-dominated sites in southeastern Wisconsin. Tatarian honeysuckle generally occurs in mesic habitats in Virginia The lower pH limit for Tatarian honeysuckle is 5.0. Tatarian honeysuckle is considered salt sensitive",

A pyramidal cluster of white blooms matures in the late spring and summer, turning purple with time. Tiny, dry seeds mature in the fall. This plant's common name is in reference to the leaves that look like those of Quercus (oak). The Oakleaf hydrangea is easily grown in organically rich, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. It needs some sun to bloom, thrives in moist soils, and appreciates a summer mulch that helps retain soil moisture. Bloom occurs on old wood. Winter damaged stems may be pruned in early spring. Plants should be given a sheltered location and winter protection (e.g., mulch, burlap wrap) in USDA Zone 5, particularly when not fully established. Plants can lose significant numbers of flower buds or die to the ground in harsh winters (temperatures below -10 degrees F), thus respectively impairing or totally destroying the bloom for the coming year. Deer love to eat this plant.",

Tolerates light shade, but best bloom is in full sun. Prefers organically rich, moist, slightly acidic to slightly alkaline soils with good drainage. Avoid siting in frost pockets where late spring frost may damage the early bloom. This shrub needs good air circulation. Good tolerance for urban conditions.

It is sensitive to heat and does not perform well in dry conditions. Standing water is tolerated if it is temporary. Growing in both full sun and part shade, however to grow at its best, locate this plant in full sun. It 1/4\" flowers bloom from the top downward. Flowers have 5 petals and many long stamens that surround a center ring. The ring ranges in color from orange to pink to yellow. Long stamens are fuzzy in appearance.

It is a pretty shrub in flower, and is often quite neat and graceful in habit, especially when 3 or 4 ft high, with its numerous thin twigs, rather pendulous. It is distinct in being unarmed and without down. Of several forms in cultivation the most distinct is var. mollis (DC.) Schneid., with leaves downy on both sides; found wild in the Caucasus. Propagation: Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame. It usually germinates in 2 weeks. Stored seed should be pre-soaked for 24 hours in warm water then sown in a cold frame. If the seed has not swollen then scarify it and re-soak for another 12 hours before sowing. Germination usually takes place within 2 - 3 weeks at 20°c. Good percentage. As soon as they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in a greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant",

It is also grown as an ornamental. Until recently, Cape Cod was famous for its beach plum jelly. Today, many so-called beach plum jellies and jams contain no beach plums. The recent interest in native plants, dune stabilization and sustainable crops has led to renewed interest in the beach plum. Winter die back is frequent in cold climates if exposed to direct wind. Prunus species may be rooted from dormant hardwood, softwood, semi-hardwood, or root cuttings. Semi-hardwood and softwood cuttings taken in summer root easiest. Germination of most seeds requires cold stratification. Some species need a period of after Seed Collection: Collect fruit when it is filled out, firm, and its ripe color. Clean seeds from pulp and briefly air dry. (Seeds to be sown immediately in fall do not need drying.) Storage viability is maintained at 31-41 degrees. Shrubs can be trained to a modified",

        "Notes": "Prunus ursina (bear's plum) is a perennial woody deciduous native shrub of the woods of Western Asia from Turkey to Syria, the Palestine region and Lebanon. Some sources include this species in Prunus cocomilia. RANGE: W. Asia - Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, Israel. HABITAT: Open woodland, steep slopes and amongst rocks in Turkey. Mediterranean maquis and forest. Mediterranean Woodlands and Shrublands, Montane vegetation of Mt. Hermon. CULTIVATION: Prefers some lime in the soil but is likely to become chlorotic if too much lime is present. Succeeds in sun or partial shade though it fruits better in a sunny position. Shallow-rooted and will produce suckers if the roots are damaged. The branches sometimes bear spines. It produces white hermaphrodite (has both male and female organs) flowers in pairs during the spring. Fruits better in full sun but is still successful in partial shade. The tree will form suckers if its shallow roots are damaged. POLLINATION: Insects. PROPAGATION: Seeds, cuttings, Layering in the spring.

Prefers evenly moist soils. Best flowering occurs in full sun, but plants tolerate part shade. Established plants grow well in a wide range of conditions and have good drought tolerance. Plants have excellent winter hardiness and perform best in cool northern summer climates. It is not recommended for planting in the southeastern U.S. south of USDA Zone 7 where they tend to struggle with high summer heat and humidity. Prune as needed in late winter. ‘Abbotswood’ is a vigorous dwarf cultivar that will provide fabulous summer color with masses of white buttercup-like flowers that cover fine bluish-green foliage. It blooms long after many plants have stopped flowering and is considered to be one of the best white flowering forms. Its compact habit reaches a height of 3 feet.

It is a good choice for attracting butterflies to your yard, but is not particularly attractive to deer who tend to leave it alone in favor of tastier treats. It has no significant negative characteristics. Jackman Potentilla will grow to be about 4 feet tall at maturity, with a spread of 4 feet.

The seedlings should be pricked out and moved into deep pots or a seedling bed when large enough to handle. The largest plants can be planted out in their permanent positions in the summer.

These two cultivars, or a cross of both, are typical of commercially grown raspberries. First year stems bear only leaves. Lateral branches in the second year produce leaves, flowers and fruits. Pruning is essential in order to keep plants well-maintained, but care must be used to avoid pruning the second-year growth that will bear fruit. It is generally best to prune out old, summer-bearing canes as soon as fruiting is over to encourage new canes. Raspberry roots are perennial but the leaf- and fruit-bearing canes are biennial, each cane living only two growing seasons before dying. American red raspberry is made up of mostly biennial canes (stems) on a long-lived perennial rootstock. Dense raspberry thickets form from the roots or stems of parent plants which separate to form individual plants with the deterioration of connecting tissue.",

In all this range, this plant plays an important role in preventing soil erosion and serves as understory vegetation.

        "Notes": "Rose seed often takes two years to germinate. This is because it may need a warm spell of weather after a cold spell in order to mature the embryo and reduce the seedcoat. One possible way to reduce this time is to scarify the seed and then place it for 2 - 3 weeks in damp peat at a temperature of 27 - 32°c (by which time the seed should have imbibed). It is then kept at 3°c for the next 4 months by which time it should be starting to germinate. Alternatively, it is possible that seed harvested 'green' (when it is fully developed but before it has dried on the plant) and sown immediately will germinate in the late winter. Seed sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame sometimes germinates in spring though it may take 18 months. Stored seed can be sown as early in the year as possible and stratified for 6 weeks at 5°C. It may take 2 years to germinate. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle. Plant out in the summer if the plants are more than 25cm tall, otherwise grow on in a cold frame for the winter and plant out in late spring.

It is then kept at 3°c for the next 4 months by which time it should be starting to germinate. Alternatively, it is possible that seed harvested 'green' (when it is fully developed but before it has dried on the plant) and sown immediately will germinate in the late winter. This method has not as yet(1988) been fully tested. Seed sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame sometimes germinates in spring though it may take 18 months.

Bradley concluded that because Saskatoon serviceberry sprouts from existing plants, fire is not likely to alter its frequency unless plants were in poor condition before fire. After light- to moderate-severity fire, it usually sprouts from the root crown or from shallowly buried rhizomes. However,deeply buried rhizomes enable Saskatoon serviceberry to sprout after even the most intense wildfire. Saskatoon serviceberry in forests is fire-dependent and declines with fire exclusion. It may persist in the understory for decades, but eventually dies out with canopy closure.",

Plants dislike root disturbance, they should be planted out into their permanent positions whilst still small. Dislikes heavy pruning, it is best not to cut out any wood thicker than a pencil. Any pruning is best carried out in the spring. Fast growing, it flowers well when young, often in its second year from seed. Seed - best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame. Stored seed should be pre-soaked for 12 hours in warm water and then given 1 - 3 months stratification at 1°c. Germination usually takes place within 1 - 2 months at 20°c. One report says that the seed is best given boiling water treatment, or heated in 4 times its volume of sand at 90 - 120°c for 4 - 5 minutes and then soaked in warm water for 12 hours before sowing it.

The species has small leaves, which it loses before summer to reduce transpiration and to increase its tolerance to drought stress. The grass-shaped stem helps to reduce the total exposed area of the plant, whereas the root is well developed and ramified. The leaves of S. junceum have thick cuticles with a waxy layer and the plant produces oils that reduce evapotranspiration, which also reduces the temperature of the plant’s microenvironment. It is also adapted to soils with high salt concentrations. This species has morphological adaptations to xerophytic conditions that allow it to endure severe drought. It thrives in full sun and can tolerate urban pollution, salt-laden winds near the coast and temperatures as low as -10°C.",

It is native to wet meadows, wet pastures, boggy areas, marshes, fields, and lake margins from Nova Scotia south to Louisiana and Georgia. As it's native location suggests, the plant needs moist acidic soils in order to grow well. This trait makes it a good selection for moist locations in the landscape or as a low hedge for paths and walkways. This is a flowering shrub with tiny pink to rose to rose-purple flowers clustered, top to bottom, on 4 to 8 inch terminal spikes that bloom from mid-summer to early autumn. Steeplebush is easy to grow in average, acidic, moist to wet soils in full sun. It will tolerate a wide range of soil and light shade, but a site with full sun is best for maximum blooming. You should remove faded flower clusters as soon as practicle to encourage additional bloom. The plant flowers on new wood, so prune in late winter to early spring if needed. This a vigorous plant that will spread by suckers to form colonies. The root system is woody and branching. The woody stems often die down to the ground during the",

Propagation: Seed - best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe. Pre-soak the seed for 24 hours in hot water (starting at a temperature of 80 - 90c and allowing it to cool) prior to sowing in order to leach out any germination inhibitors. This soak water can be drunk and has a delicious lemon-flavour. The stored seed also needs hot water treatment and can be sown in early spring in a cold frame.

It occurs on the edges of many forest types, and is a frequent member of early oldfield communities, particularly on dry soils. This beautiful plant's fall foliage is a spectacular blaze of red and orange, and its spikes of velvety, crimson berries are attractive all winter. However, it spreads so vigorously through root suckering that it is hard to use in the residential landscape. Will grow in almost any soil except swamps; great for dry, sterile banks or roadsides. A great bird habitat, attractive year-round. Combine with fall blooming asters and goldenrods for a dramatic fall show. Propagation: Seed - best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe. Pre-soak the seed for 24 hours in hot water (starting at a temperature of 80 - 90c and allowing it to cool) prior to sowing in order to leach out any germination inhibitors. This soak water can be drunk and has a delicious lemon-flavour. The store",

This shrubby, upright, deciduous, native perennial grows to approximately 3 feet in height. It will tiller at the base, sending up multiple stems. The root system consists of a stout, deeply anchored reddish taproot. It has shallow, fibrous root hairs near the surface and thick, burllike, deep, woody roots. Root crown diameter can be quite large after repeated fires. The common name for New Jersey tea is red root. In early summer it is covered with fragrant clusters of creamy white flowers. New Jersy Tea grows best in well-drained sandy loam or rocky soils in full sun to partial shade. It is drought tolerant once established and tolerates road salt. The New Jersey tea is susceptible to leaf spot and powdery mildew. Prone to root rot in wet soils and canker disease. Nitrogen-fixing shrub",

The yellow flowers, which appear in spring to early summer, are solitary or arranged in dense groups at the tips of branches. The fruit is a small lance-shaped pod usually containing one or two hard seeds. The basic method of rooibos harvesting has remained largely the same as the process used centuries ago. An environmentally friendly way of harvesting tea is used that involves cutting only the young branches. Once they are cut, they are neatly bound and transported to the process yards. The older branches are left on the tree and the bushes get slightly taller every year. The tea cuttings are chopped very fine and then bruised to ensure that the important chemical reaction which develops the characteristic colour and flavour of the tea can take place. After watering and airing, the tea is left to \"sweat\" in heaps and it at this point that the tea acquires its typical reddish brown colour and develops its",

The reddish-brown to tan fruits are found between the seeds, with a short narrow beak at the end Found mainly in deep moist soil, but also in dry, rocky or saline soils. Abundant along river banks, canals and irrigation ditches, sometimes spreading into cultivated fields. Propagation: Seed - pre-soak the seed for 12 hours in warm water and sow early to mid spring in a warm greenhouse.

In USDA Zones 5 and 6, this shrub often suffers winter dieback or dies to the ground. It is not considered reliably winter hardy throughout USDA Zone 5. Even though plants may die to the ground in Zone 5-6 winters, the roots often survive the winter and push up as much a 4-7' of new growth the following year. Because flowering appears on new growth, winter dieback or pruning back to the ground will not affect flowering. In the St. Louis area, this shrub is often regularly pruned close to the ground in early spring each year in somewhat the same manner as is also usually done with crape myrtles. Vitex agnus-castus, commonly called chaste tree, is typically grown in warm winter climates as a vase-shaped, deciduous shrub (to 10-15' tall) or trained as a single trunk tree to 20' tall.

Commonly used as a rootstock for other Viburnum species. Mohican Wayfaring tree viburnum (Viburnum lantana ‘Mohican’): A compact, 8 to 10 feet high and wide, rounded shrub; thick, leathery, dark green leaves turn a purplish-red fall color. Attractive orange-red fruit in early July maintains good color for 4 weeks or more. Variegatum Wayfaring viburnum (Viburnum lantana 'Variegatum'): Compact, 8 to 10 feet high and wide; dark green leaves with flecks of chartreuse, lime and gold. Best planted in part shade to full shade to avoid leaf burn. Liabilities: easily gets out-of-bounds due to its vigorous growth; somewhat malodorous inflorescences, legginess with age, in part hidden by the basal suckers; fruit set is often poor to non-existent; as an occasional rootstock to other Viburnums, it may emerge as suckers from beneath these other species and quickly outgrow its grafted scion. Wayfaringtree: apparently a tree for the wayfarer, i.e., traveler, V. lantana was common along waysides. However, John Parkinson (Paradisi in sole Paradisus Terrestris, 1629,",

Pussy willow regenerates vegetatively from basal sprouts, and broken branches that lodge in moist soil may root and grow. There are reports of willows used as fence posts that rooted and grew into shrubs or trees. Susceptible to numerous disease problems including blights, powdery mildew, leaf spots, gray scab and cankers. It also is visited by many insect pests including aphids, scale, borers, lacebugs and caterpillars. Wood is weak and may crack. Branches may be damaged by ice and snow.

        "Notes": "Formerly named Salix exigua. This shrub has two growth forms: a small tree up to 20' tall with a trunk up to 6\" across, or a thicket of little-branched woody stems up to 8' tall. Woody branches and slender stems are variably colored, but often gray or yellowish-brown and smooth. Sandbar Willow is dioecious: male florets and female florets are produced on separate plants in the form of catkins. The root system is branching and woody, often forming underground runners that develop into vegetative offshoots. Colonies of plants are often formed from these clonal offshoots. This willow can spread aggressively from vegetative offshoots. Standing water is tolerated if it is temporary. A new willow shrub can be cultivated by breaking off a stem and sticking it into moist ground; new leaves will develop at the top while new roots develop below the ground surface. Habitats include shrub swamps, borders of ponds and slow-moving rivers, gravel bars and sandbars, lake shore beaches, marshes, damp swales in prairies, and ditches. Narrowleaf willow communities often act as firebreaks due to their occurrence on sites with high water tables or near streams, but they may burn during unusually dry ye",

Adaptable to both light and heavy soils, but prefers moist, acidic, organic loams. Good tolerance for poorly drained soils including wet boggy or swampy conditions (this species is native to swampy areas of Eastern North America). Winterberries are dioecious (separate male and female plants). Only fertilized female flowers will produce the attractive red berries that are the signature of the species. Generally one male winterberry will be sufficient for pollinating 6-10 female plants. Flowers appear on new growth. Prune to shape in early spring just before new growth appears. Propagation: Softwood cuttings started in spring. Seeds of most holly species require 2-3 years of dormancy before they will germinate.",

It competes vigorously with other plant species, but does best in disturbed habitats in tropical or sub-tropical regions with a distinct wet and dry season. It has a deep taproot and can withstand drought, mowing and shallow tillage. It is a weed of degraded pastures, tree plantations, cereals, root crops, vegetables, planted forests, lawns, roadsides, and waste places. In habitats where it occurs, it tends to flourish in riparian areas near watercourses. It has been reported at up to 1500 m altitude in Indonesia, at medium and higher elevations in Kenya and in the foothills of the Andes in Peru.",
