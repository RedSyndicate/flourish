        "Notes": "Pseudosasa japonica, commonly known as arrow bamboo, green onion bamboo or metake, is a vigorous evergreen, running-type bamboo that forms a thicket of woody, hollow, upright culms (often called canes) to 12-16’ tall clad with dense, glossy, coarse, lanceolate, dark green leaves (to 5-13” long by 1 3/4’ wide) which taper to pointed tips. It is native to Japan and Korea, but has escaped planting areas and naturalized in a number of locations in the U.S. from New York and Connecticut south to Tennessee and South Carolina plus Florida and California. Though Arrow Bamboo is considered a \"running bamboo,\" it's one that spreads very slowly and is very easy to control, so much so that we call it a semi-clumper. Arrow Bamboo can be controlled in a small area (a normal city yard) simply by mowing or stepping on the young shoots. Keep in mind that running bamboo only puts up new shoots for a short time each year and, when they are \"shooting,\" the new plants are very fragile and easy to destroy. Root pruning or installing Bamboo Root Barrier are other methods to control spread. Spikelets of 2-8 non-showy green flowers in lax panicles rarely appear. Rarely flowers.

In southern China, flowering activity has been reported when plants are at the age of 50 years, and clumps usually die after flowering. Bambusa tuldoides is a species of bamboo native to Asia that is is widely cultivated as ornamental and hedge plant but also for its culms. It has been introduced elsewhere in Asia outside of its native range, as well as in the Americas and Pacific region. Culms and branches root very readily and often grow to form monospecific stands along riverbanks, low hills, roadsides and disturbed sites. This species is adapted to grow in a wide range of climates and can survive temperatures as low as -7°C. Currently, B. tuldoides is considered an invasive and transformer species in Cuba. It is also included in the Global Compendium of weeds as an “agricultural weed”. Bambusa tuldoides prefers lowland tropical and subtropical areas.",

Life cycle of clump >50 years. In Tripura, southern Assam and Sylhet, indigenous people have identified two distinct forms of culms known as ‘Sil’ and ‘Nali’ types in which the former is much stronger and harder than the later. The ‘Sil’ culm type is mostly preferred for heavy construction and furniture purposes because relatively short internodal length and distinct swollen supranodal rings up to 14-16 is found in nodal zone than the Nali type. B. balcooa has long flowering cycle of only once during its life time around 55-60 years or even >90 years (Banik, 1985) and the clump dies without seed production. The only way to raise bulk planting materials is by means of vegetative propagation or through tissue culture. Vegetative propagation through culm cuttings, branch cuttings, or rhizomes is difficult on account of few and bulky propagules, season specificity, and low rooting ability of the culm. Propag",

The fast growing, strong woody culms of Bambusa bambos have an average diameter between 10-18 cm, and are between 20-30 m tall (although the tallest recorded culm measured 40 m). The internodes are dark green colored with very thick walls. Nodes are slightly swollen and some lower nodes produce short aerial roots. Nodes contain a central dominant branch with one or two lateral branches and are often spine-like. Thorny lower branches are long and wiry, and usually bent towards the ground. The upper leafy branches produce a fan like plume and bearing small spines.﻿Bambusa bambos prefers a humid tropical climate and grows best along river banks or river valleys with a rich, moist soil. It reaches its best development in moist deciduous forests. In India this species occupies 15% of all bamboo forests. Twelve-year-old clumps are regarded as mature. One of the best bamboos for windy sites due to the strength of the culms, it is often planted to form wind-breaks around farms - when planted as a hedge around a farm or field, it requires little care.",

In fact, when the plant is young, it can sometimes grow 3 feet in less than a day. Flowers every 30-60 years. Roots extend horizontally. Mixed deciduous forest in plains, valleys, and along streams, up to elevations of 1,500 metres. Common on flat alluvial land along streams in the mixed deciduous forests and along the banks of dry water-courses in Myanmar. Shoot growth starts at the beginning of the rainy season and it takes approximately 1 month to emerge above the ground. Height increase of the shoots may attain as much as 70 cm per day. Culms complete their growth within 2 - 3 months after their emergence as shoots, and their diameter and height do not increase as they become older. Bamboos in general are usually monocarpic, living for many years before flowering, then flowering and seeding profusely for a period of 1 - 3 years before usually dying. Bengal bamboo normally flowers gregariously for a period of 2 years in a cycle of 25 - 40 years, and produces viable seed. However, it also often flowers sporadically or in small groups, with",

In southern China, flowering activity has been reported when plants are at the age of 50 years, and clumps usually die after flowering. Bambusa tuldoides is a species of bamboo native to Asia that is is widely cultivated as ornamental and hedge plant but also for its culms. It has been introduced elsewhere in Asia outside of its native range, as well as in the Americas and Pacific region. Culms and branches root very readily and often grow to form monospecific stands along riverbanks, low hills, roadsides and disturbed sites. This species is adapted to grow in a wide range of climates and can survive temperatures as low as -7°C. Currently, B. tuldoides is considered an invasive and transformer species in Cuba. It is also included in the Global Compendium of weeds as an “agricultural weed”. Bambusa tuldoides prefers lowland tropical and subtropical areas.",

        "Notes": "Clumping bamboo. Gregarious flowering every 24-45 years with sporadic flowering almost every year. Leaf size and culm density varies in wet versus dry conditions. Each plant produces a number of new stems annually - these stems grow to their maximum height in their first year of growth, subsequent growth in the stem being limited to the production of new side branches and leaves. In the case of some mature tropical species the new stem could be as much as 30 metres tall, with daily increases in height of 30cm or more during their peak growth time. This makes them some of the fastest-growing species in the world. The new rhizomes of seedlings first bend downwards before curving upwards to form their aerial shoots - thus successive shoots are not only larger than the preceding ones but also arise from rhizomes that are deeper in the soil. Early shoots are thin, wiry and grass-like, but as the clump develops the new shoots become progressively more woody and larger. A clump is considered mature when it starts producing full-sized culms – in nature this can take 11—13 years, though in cultivation it can be as little as 6 years.",

The culms are straight and erect to about 45 to 50 feet tall with a 4 inch diameter in the tropics, but more in the 20 to 30 foot range elsewhere. Though considered a clumping bamboo, the new culms can arise up to 2 feet away from the base, so older clumps are relatively open with new shoots starting off a medium-green color and darkening as they mature. Plant in full sun with regular irrigation and fertilize often. Grows best in warm conditions with only light frosts. It is considered hardy to 25°F This bamboo comes from the Indonesian island of Timor. It has also been sold as Gigantochloa atroviolacea.",

Barley grains are a caryopsis, a single dry grain, that is tan in color. It is native to Iraq, and is widely grown throughout temperate regions of the world. With two-row barley only the center spikelet is fertile, the lateral ones sterile. There are thousands of cultivated barley landraces and hundreds of cultivars. Cultivars are classified according to several factors: number of rows of grains (2-row and 6-row barley), compactness of spikes, hull adherence (hulled or naked barley), presence or size of awns (awned, awnletted or awnless varieties), growth habit (winter or spring barley) and colour (black, purple or white kernels). Barley is best adapted to rich, well-drained, loamy soils and should not be planted on poor, sandy or wet soils. It prefers a soil pH above 6 but will survive as low as 4.3. It is less winter hardy than wheat or rye. Barley is sensitive to rust and disease: it should not be sown in milder climates or too early during autumn. It should not be sown under humid tropical climates.",

Within North America, sheep fescue has been planted in open forests and mountain and foothill slopes from Alaska to North Dakota and south to Arizona and New Mexico. It has also been introduced to many locations in eastern North America. Hair like grass blades which are bright chartreuse. Sheep fescue is an exotic turfgrass that was once widely planted because of its drought-tolerance and ability to grow in difficult conditions due to its association with mycorrhizae. Its delicate, bluish-green leaves, arise from dense tufts, and the 'glauca' cultivar is an attractive garden plant.",

It is now widely spread throughout North America from Newfoundland to Alaska and all the continental United States except Florida and is present in all states of New England. It is also present in New Zealand where it is fully naturalised. Some consider it an invasive weed: it is present on a number of invasive plant lists in North America, and is banned in Connecticut and listed as invasive and “potentially of national concern” in Canada.P. compressa is unable to compete with other grasses on good soils and generally develops best on soils of low fertility or poor drainage. It has moderate drought and salinity tolerances but is not shade tolerant. The blooming period occurs during the summer, lasting about 1-2 weeks for a colony of plants. The florets are cross-pollinated by the wind. The entire inflorescence becomes tan as the grains become mature. Disarticulation of the spikelets is above the glumes. Mature grains are about 1.5 mm. long, ellipsoid in shape, grooved along one s",

Open sod is produced where moisture is sufficient, but bunches 6-8\" or more in diameter are formed in drier soils. Little bluestem is generally nonrhizomatous [94], but occasionally on wet sites it may form an open or loose sod with short rhizomes connecting small tufts. The old (invalid) scientific name is Andropogon scoparium. Little bluestem clumps grow 1-2 feet high, until late summer when the stems elongate into flowering stems which may reach 5 feet. It has coarse stems and basal leaves. It is slow to emerge in the spring but continues to grow through the summer until the first killing frost. The new shoots are very flat and bluish. The leaves are soft-looking, narrow, and smooth, except at the base next to the sheath where they are often covered with hair.

Its global distribution is limited to western Asia and flora Iranica describe it as a semi-steppe to steppe species which is found in 4,921 -11,155 feet elevation. This species lives in rocky lands & freely disperses its root in the soil. Elevation, precipitation and temperature are the most important environmental factors affecting this species. In Isfahan province (part of Central Zagros region), this species can be at 6,234 -12,139 feet. Its populations are more dense in the plains in comparison with mountains. It naturally grows in Zagros & Alborz mountains rangelands in the west & north of Iran. Plant Hardiness Zones 5-13. PROPAGATION: Seeds, cuttings.",

Typical habitat is freshwater marshes, swampy open valleys, slough and pond margins, low spots along roads and railroads and both wet and dry prairie areas Sharp-pointed rhizomes. Prefers deep, heavy wet lowland soils. Exhibits double-dormancy, takes 2 years to germinate- few seeds are viable. Likes swales, ditches and wet prairies. Usually found growing in large colonies. Best grown in fertile, moist to wet loams in full sun to part shade. Plants tolerate sandy or rocky soils. This grass will spreads by rhizomes to form large colonies. Plants also tolerate some dry soils where they tend to grow/spread less aggressively. Propagate by division.",

This is a prairie grass that is native from Quebec to Saskatchewan south to Colorado, Texas and Connecticut. Fine-textured, hair-like, medium green leaves (to 20” long and 1/16” wide) typically form an arching foliage mound to 15” tall and 18” wide. Foliage turns golden with orange hues in fall, fading to light bronze in winter. Open, branching flower panicles appear on slender stems which rise well above the foliage clump in late summer to 30-36\" tall.. Tiny rounded mature seeds drop to the ground from their hulls in autumn giving rise to the descriptive common name. Easily grown in average, dry to medium, well-drained soils in full sun. Tolerates wide range of soils, including heavy clays. Prefers dry, rocky soils. Good drought tolerance. Slow-growing and slow to establish. May be grown from seed but does not freely self-seed in the garden. Adaptable ph tolerance. Fragrant flowers. Attractive bunchgrass, with delicate seed heads.",

        "Notes": "Sand dropseed is a long lived perennial warm season bunchgrass, native throughout North America It grows in sandy soils and washes, on rocky slopes and calcareous ridges, and along roadsides in salt-desert scrub, pinyon-juniper woodlands, yellow pine forests, and desert grasslands. Its elevational range is 0-2900 m. Plants are typically erect but may also be decumbent. The roots of sand dropseed are fine, 2/100 of an inch (0.5 mm) or less in diameter, stretching from a short stocky rhizome [35]. These fine roots may stretch laterally up to 10 inches (25 cm) and up to 31 inches (78 cm) down through the soil. At 2 to 3 inches (5-8 cm) below the soil surface, lateral roots branch and rebranch continuously forming a dense, soil binding mat. Sand dropseed is extremely drought tolerant and is adapted to sites receiving 7 to 16 inches annual precipitation. Its fine root system allows sand dropseed to extract water at depths between 0 and 30 cm more effectively than broom snakeweed (Gutierrezia sarothrae)). During periods of summer drought the leaves roll up to reduce surface area and evapotranspiration. It is considered to be one of the most drought resistant species in short-grass prai",

Clumps of buffel grass under trees and shrubs can also increase localised fire intensity and flame height, damaging woody species. Strategies are needed to prevent more frequent, extensive wildfires.

Congo grass has a dense system of bunched, quickly growing roots that can go down to a depth of 1.8 m. Congo grass can be propagated both from root stock and from seeds. he vigor of Congo grass seedlings is high and prevents weed development. If Congo grass is vegetatively propagated, stem cuttings with rooting nodes are necessary. As Congo grass requires good soil fertility, it is important to provide N, P and K fertilizers prior to planting and during growth. Once it is established, and provided it receives enough N fertilizer, Congo grass spreads readily. Congo grass flowers later than signal grass (Schultze-Kraft et al., 1992). It should be cut before first flowering and then at six week intervals. When grazed, Congo grass withstands limited heavy grazing. It gives good early wet season growth for eight weeks after the opening rains. Ruzi grass requires light to loam soils of moderately high fertility (pH 5.0–6.8) and cannot tolerate strongly acid conditions.",

It spreads quickly and is difficult to control. It has been widely introduced in the previous several decades as a potential forage grass and has escaped from cultivation. There are risks of its further introduction, to e.g. tropical America where it would pose a serious threat to agriculture. The species is widespread in Sudanian and Guinean savannahs of Africa though sparse in littoral areas, where it is a common agricultural weed, present on cultivated fields, also managed grasslands as well as extensively grazed savannahs. It is a weed in tropical uplands and croplands following disturbance or forest clearing, but is less common within forests and plantations, performing poorly under dense shade. Where introduced in India and Nepal it is also found on cultivated and pasture lands. The species controlled water loss effectively and has a very strong recovery ability after watering even under severe drought conditions.",

This species has both native and introduced populations in close proximity since it is both native to North America and has had European transplants cultivated for agricultural use.

Tolerant of short term flooding by moving water. Tolerance of low soil pH and high Al+++ saturation is also variable. 'Vencedor' and 'Centenário' were bred for these tolerances; other varieties require liming on acid ultisols and oxisols for best results. The species is generally intolerant of waterlogging or salinity. Combines well with twining legumes under light grazing. As these legumes are generally less tolerant of grazing than the grass, the legume component declines and weeds increase under heavier grazing. P. maximum should not be planted with less palatable grasses. This leads to selection and decline of the P. maximum .

It is also found in Europe and Asia. In Missouri, it is typically found in dry prairies and open woods. It typically grows in a compact, erect clump to 2’ tall. Mostly basal leaves (to 7” long) are medium to bright green, but may be tinged with gray-green. Easily grown in dry to medium, well-drained soils in full sun. Thrives in rocky or gritty soils. Needs superior drainage. Tolerates drought. Avoid wet and/or heavy soils or shade. May be grown from seed which can be scattered on the ground for large plantings in fields. Will self-seed in optimum growing conditions. Junegrass grows to mature height and flowers by June, but thereafter may go dormant in hot and humid summer climates. In cool summer climates, it will usually remain attractive until fall. Plants may be short-lived. Cold hardiness depends upon the area from where the seed was harvested.

It is a compact, upright, warm season, clump-forming ornamental grass which typically grows to 3-4' (infrequently to 5') tall. Features medium green blades (1/2\" wide) with a reddish tinge which gradually develop further reddish hues as summer progresses, eventually turning a brilliant orange-red in fall. Foliage gradually darkens to an attractive burgundy by winter. Tiny reddish-tinged flowers appear in tassel-like inflorescences above the foliage in late summer, gradually turning into creamy white plumes by fall as the seeds mature. Burgundy foliage and creamy white seed plumes persist well into winter providing good winter interest. Some authorities maintain that this grass is neither a cultivar nor a variety of M. sinensis, but is a hybrid of unknown parentage which should be designated as M. 'Purpurascens'.",

Common reed is native to Puerto Rico and occurs as a nonnative in HawaiiWill grow in standing water. Extensive genetics studies on common reed plant material from modern and herbarium samples (dated to the 1850s) collected throughout North America revealed there are 11 native haplotypes and 1 nonnative haplotype. Introduction of the nonnative haplotype probably occurred at 1 or more Atlantic Coast ports early in the 19th century, and because morphological differences between the haplotypes are subtle, the introduction(s) went unnoticed. Range expansion of the nonnative haplotype was likely facilitated by travel way construction during this time period. The nonnative haplotype is dominant along the Atlantic Coast and in the Great Lakes area. In western North America, the nonnative haplotype is becoming common along roadsides and waterways in urban areas, but native types",

Creeping rhizomes are long, slender or stout, and deep-seated , ranging from 0.4 inches to 8 feet (1 cm to 2.5 m) long. Rhizomes generally lack roots, but roots occasionally do grow from the preceding year's rhizomes. Beaked sedge is infrequent and local in large portions of its range, often forming large colonies. It may grow in nearly pure stands , covering broad valley bottoms, riparian areas, and wetlands. It can form dense mats when growing on saturated sites, often precluding the establishment of competing grasses and forbs. Beaked sedge can form a loose floating mat in oligotrophic lakes. Beaked sedge is wind-pollinated.",

Spreads quickly, forms dense stand, but is a poor competitor with other perennials such as Reed Canary Grass. Habitats include depressions in floodplain woodlands, flatwoods, soggy thickets, wet black soil prairies, wet dolomite prairies, prairie swales, typical marshes and sandy marshes, typical swamps and sandy swamps, seeps and fens, sedge meadows, and borders of ponds or small lakes. Sometimes Lake Sedge is the dominant sedge in these habitats. It is not uncommon to find this sedge growing in shallow water. Has attractive dark green foliage that has a slight blue tinge when young. The root system is fibrous and long-rhizomatous. This sedge often forms large clonal colonies of plants. The preference is full or partial sun, wet conditions, and soil containing mud, silt, or calcareous sand. This large sedge can spread aggressively by means of its rhizomes. While it can tolerate light shade, this sedge may not produce any spikelets. Seasonal flooding is readily tolerated.",

It will not do well in hot, dry sites and the colorful grass, which turns from green to red and burgundy in the fall, will be dull if it does not receive enough light. Frost grass has a bamboo-like quality and the foliage can create bold patterns with purplish or wine tints late in the season. This is a clumping grass and, unlike some ornamental grasses, is not considered invasive. Frost grass grows best in full sun to light shade with a moist, well-drained soil. It does poorly in hot, dry situations and too much shade produces floppy growth. This is a warm season grass, so its most active growth occurs in summer. It remains upright in winter and can act as winter interest. Because it remains attractive through winter, do not cut it back until early spring before new growth begins. At that time, it can be cut down to the ground.",

Seed viability is lost if the seed is allowed to dry below 28% moisture.

S. spontaneum is a perennial grass with slender culms, 100-200 cm tall, growing in stools or forming continuous cane-brakes and usually exhibiting vigorous rhizomatous tillering. Culms remain green, grey, ivory or white, hard, but very pithy and often hollow in the center, varying in diameter from 5 to 15 mm; often rooting at the nodes, internodes usually long and nodes always thicker than internodes. Range: Tropical and subtropical areas of Africa, E. Asia - India, Malaysia, Indo-China. Habitat: Swamps, saline swamps, deserts, jungles, sandy river flats, and the low slopes of the Himalayas.",

Because of its aggressive, rhizomatous nature it can be difficult to eliminate if it has spread to areas where it is not wanted. Known for its aromatic vanilla-scented leaves, it was burned and used ceremonially in North American indigenous cultures to attract good spirits. It can be harvested, braided and burned as ‘smudge.’ Occurring naturally in wetlands, or prairies and savannas with medium-wet soils, Sweet Grass requires a rich moist soil and at least 6 hours sun a day. Heirochloe odorata is somewhat aggressive and should be planted where it can spread naturally, as it can be difficult to remove it, once it becomes established.Green foliage; tan, inconspicuous flower; long 2-3' leaves that lay on the ground; very invasive, needs containment. Its natural habitat is wetlands, prairies, and savannas in wet to medium moisture soils. Though Sweet Grass prefers rich, moist soils, it will grow in almost any soil that receives a minimum of a half day of sun.
