It is a climbing member of the cucumber family that can be used as a vegetable in salads, or steamed, it has a nice sweet flavor. It is also an herbal plant, the fruit has anti-inflammatory, weight reducing ( it is often sold in capsule form as a natural weight loss product ), lipid-absorbing, cholesterol and blood sugar regulating affects. Can easily be grown in the garden, on a fence or trellis. It is an annual plant. One of the most interesting aspects of the plants is that when ripe, the fruits become spring-loaded missile devices, splitting and turning themselves inside-out to launch their seeds up to 5-6 feet away into the garden. This is quite the conversation plant. The achocha is occasionally cultivated for its edible fruit in S. America, there are many named forms. The fruit flesh is soft and spongy, not crunchy, only 0.5 cm thick, and is said to have a flavor resembling that of cucumbers. Except for the flesh and the 12 or so seeds attached to one placenta lobe, the fruit is hollow.

Barley forage is mostly used in North America, Europe and the Mediterranean area. Barley forage is better suited to cooler, drier areas than other small grain cereals. Barley is best adapted to rich, well-drained, loamy soils and should not be planted on poor, sandy or wet soil. It prefers a soil pH above 6. Barley can withstand moderate droughts and does well on alkaline and saline soils. It is less winter hardy than wheat or rye. Barley is sensitive to rust and disease: it should not be sown in milder climates or too early during autumn. Barley forage can be sown as the sole crop or in mixture with a legume such as vetch, pea, berseem (Trifolium alexandrinum) or Persian clover (Trifolium resupinatum). Intercropping is effective for reducing diseases, suppressing weeds and capturing a greater share of available resources: intercropped barley-legumes have a higher total yield than barley or legume as a sole cropal. Intercropping barley with a legume improves the nutritive value by increasing the DM and protein content of th",

HABITAT: Anthropogenic (man-made or disturbed habitats), sandy soils of prairies and pastures, occasionally on granite in meadows, fields, grassy flats and grassy areas in open woodlands. - ELEVATION: Up to 4,000 feet. - PROPAGATION: Seeds (Yellow-brown to brown, with short, nipplelike point at top Stem cuttings. Root divisions. The fruit is dry but does not split open when ripe. - Flower bisexual, bilateral - The genus Monarda gets its name from the Spanish botanist, physician, and explorer Nicholas Monardes (1512-1588), who wrote one of the seminal European works on American plants. Resistant to deer. Spreads rapidly by underground stolons. Once the flower fades & the petals drop off, a brown seed head develops. It is best to allow the seed heads to dry on the plant & then collect the seeds.",

This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby. The feathery green leaves fold together when touched and in the evening as darkness approaches. Partridge pea is an excellent plant to use in disturbed areas as it tends to establish quickly. It is a prolific self-seeder and is also fairly salt tolerant. Partridge pea is easily propagated by seed. Collect seed pods in the fall once they have turned brown and are falling from the plant. It is also a nitrogen-fixer, so it may improve and enrich soils, allowing for the introduction of more demanding plants into your landscape. Partridge pea is favored by frequent fire.

        "Notes": "G. aparine is an annual herb that reproduces solely by seed. It behaves predominantly as a winter annual, and has been described as one of the most winter hardy weeds of winter-sown crops in Germany. In Japan, germination and emergence occurred between mid-November and February, with a peak in December, approximately 40 days after initial germination (Noda et al., 1965). In some years, a second flush of germination was observed in late February or March. This protracted germination periodicity helps G. aparine to escape herbicide treatments. In Canada, flowering begins in late May and is completed by mid-June, with mature fruits present from late June to mid-July (Moore, 1975). In some instances, flowering plants have been collected as late as August and September. In the UK, some emergence was observed in the field as late as April and May (Froud-Williams et al., 1984). Flowers are self-compatible and self-pollinated, each giving rise to two seeds. On average, one plant produces 300-400 seeds. Seeds of G. aparine buried in the soil display cyclical changes in dormancy, they lose dormancy in the autumn and re-acquire it in the spring so that seeds are dormant in the summer months.",

Florida pusley is a summer annual found most often in warm season turfgrass areas. The leaves can be hairy and grow opposite one another on hairy stems. The growth of Florida pusley in maintained turf areas is usually low and prostrate to the ground, forming thick patches. The growth can be erect with infrequent mowing. Florida pusley usually will not root at the nodes. The flowers are white and grow in clumps at the end of the stems. The flower is star shaped with six parts connected to form a tube. Florida pusley will flower anytime the temperature is above freezing. Florida pusley spreads by seed. Florida pusley is found in areas of the United States where warm-season grasses proliferate.",

Subclover can also be cut for hay and silage . It was referred to as the most productive legume for vineyards and orchards where its mat of creeping stems provides good cover against soil erosion during winter. Thanks to its profuse self-regeneration, subclover can be used for land revegetation and as a green manure. Subclover can be cultivated in rainfed and irrigated orchards. Subclover is used for controlling fires in Mediterranean forests (strips to be grazed between forests) or as green winter culture in viticulture or arboriculture to avoid erosion. It can help to reduce soil erosion when combined to vegetable crops. Unlike most clovers, sub clover is self-pollinated.",

The inflorescence absorbs water easily and becomes too heavy for weak stems in tall cultivar selections, causing bending or breakage. Staking the plants helps. Regular watering of the root zone is a must as a lack of water will make the leaves appear wilted.

Any seed that does not swell should be carefully pricked with a needle, taking care not to damage the embryo, and re-soaked for a further 24 hours. Germination can be slow and erratic but is usually within 4 - 9 weeks or more at 13°c if the seed is treated or sown fresh.

Light afternoon shade helps avoid possible sun scald in hot summer climates. Best growth occurs in cool and dry summer climates. Plants dislike areas with high humidity and frequent rain. Seeds may be planted directly in garden soil after the last spring frost date. They may also be planted in pots. Plants grow rapidly (pinching off young leaves can begin in 30 days). Snip off flower stems before flowering to prolong harvest of leaves. Plant new seed every 2 weeks to insure a continuous crop of leaves. Allow some plants to flower and seed if harvest of coriander seed is desired. Seeds are ready for harvest in 90 days. Plants tend to bolt easily (abandon leaf growth, flower, seed and die) in hot summer climates. A late summer planting of seed can be done for fall harvest of leaves but seed will not mature before frost. Plants are annuals but have naturalized in some parts of North Americars. Plants are noted for bolting in hot summer weather. Coriander has its origin in the Near East. It is not known from the wild, but is widely cultivated, and escapees from cultivati",

Kochia is native to central and eastern Europe and Asia (Whitson et al., 1991) and was likely introduced as an ornamental in the mid- to late 1800’s. Germination of seeds can occur multiple times throughout the growing season (Friesen et al., 2009), enabling it to take advantage of moisture when it is available. Seeds are able to germinate under high stress conditions, such as lack of moisture, high salinity, or extremes in pH. Kochia is a facultative lkali halophyte and is tolerant of thin or high salinity soils or acidic soils due to the presence of aluminum or manganese.",

It is well adapted to short-return-interval grassland fires, which are characterized by flashy fuels and rapid fire fronts that burn through quickly and cause little soil heating and damage to seed. Vulpia myuros is an annual grass, native to much of Europe and parts of Asia, introduced to the USA, Australia and a number of other countries, and reported as invasive in Australia, the western USA and parts of the Pacific. It outcompetes native species in grasslands of the western US and is a significant agricultural weed. It forms dense swards and its shallow roots suppress growth of native grasses and forbs.

Cannabis thrives on rich, fertile, neutral to slightly alkaline, well-drained silt or clay loams with moisture retentive subsoils, it does not grow well on acid, sandy soils. Of the many types of hemp, some are adapted to most vegetated terrains and climates. Cannabis is reported to tolerate an annual precipitation range of 30 to 400cm, an average annual temperature range of 6 to 27C and a pH in the range of 4.5 to 8.2. Different cultivars of the species have been bred for both higher and lower THC (the component used as an euphoric drug) and CBDs (the component used for pain and inflammatory relief). Plants require little cultivation, except for weeding during early stages of growth. Hemp grows rapidly and soon crowds out weeds. After the plants are 20 cm tall, weeding is abandoned.

The low-growing, upright to sprawling plants have a number of weak stems arising from the base that may be erect or lay almost horizontal on the ground. The stems are green but often become purple with age, and may root at the low nodes. The finely hairy stems are covered with downward-pointing hairs. Plants may be 4 to 15 inches tall. They either die after setting seed or go dormant during the hot weather of summer and bloom in the fall. Henbit grows best in cool, moist areas. It is primarily a problem in open areas of gardens or in weak, thin lawns. It can be discouraged in lawns by maintaining a dense turf through proper mowing and fertilization, and in shaded lawns by growing grass species more adapted to less sun which will better compete with weeds. Although often classified as an annual plant, this species may overwinter as a seedling or as a seed and become a biennial. Seedlings emerge from moist, cool soil in autumn and early spring.

        "Notes": "From Richo Cech at Strictly Medicinal Seeds \"Temperate Tulsi (AKA: “Holy Basil,” Latin unknown) was introduced by the now-defunct Abundant Life Seed Foundation. The plant has been grown successfully as a quick summer annual and is well-loved by American gardeners. The aroma is tutti-frutti, the plant bolts fast to flower, it magnetizes bees and is the only basil I know of that readily self-seeds from seed dropped the year before. To make the most of the leaf, it works best to direct-seed the plant in the spring garden and harvest on an ongoing basis, cutting back just prior to flowering. The plants are globe-shaped and do not get very tall–a foot or two at best. Careful management of the timing of planting and harvest can result in a good deal of dried tea from a few plants. This is the tea that we grow and dry for our own personal use, and it has been shown to be a healthy drink for our family. Here are the results of one of our analytical tests of Temperate Tulsi: 0.74 Eugenol, 5.53 Rosmarinic Acid expressed as dried wt in mg/g.\"",

        "Notes": "Whether as foreign material in crop seed or as an intended fiber crop, velvetleaf arrived in North America probably before 1700, and became widespread along the East Coast by the early 1700s. Because the colonies desperately needed fiber for rope and cloth, velvetleaf was widely cultivated in the mid-1700s. Although attempts to process velvetleaf fiber never succeeded economically, U. S. farmers continued to cultivate it for more than 100 years. A. theophrasti has some freely moving leaves that maintain a small angle between the normal to the leaf and the sun's rays . The freely moving leaves have higher total daily carbon gain, transpiration and water use efficiency than leaves fixed in a horizontal position. Propagation is always by seeds, which are produced in large numbers, varying from 700 to 44,200 per plant. Seeds mature 17-22 days after pollination. Seeds are dispersed by opening of each carpel with a vertical slit along the outer edge. Seeds are known to remain viable for up to 50 years when stored dry or in the soil. It is known to have developed resistance to many herbicides used in agriculture.",

The plant has short stout stems and resists wind and heavy rain. It is also more resistant than barley or quinoa to low night temperatures. Plants do not like excess humidity. Adult plants are unaffected by night frosts in the growing season, the seed can germinate at a soil temperature of 5c, whilst the plant will flower at 10c and ripen its seed at 15c. The flowers are closed at fertility and so seem to be almost exclusively self-pollinating. Kaniwa is so cold hardy that in the high Andes it serves subsistence farmers as a “safety-net.” When all else fails, kaniwa still provides food. Indeed, it is perhaps more resistant than any other grain crop to a combination of frost, drought, salt, and pests—and few other food plants are as easy to grow or demand such little care. Moreover, although its grains are small, few cereals can match their protein content of around 16 percent. .",

Kiwicha and other amaranths adapt to many environments and tolerate adversity because they convert the raw materials of soil, sunlight, and water into plant tissues by using an especially efficient type of photosynthesis. Known technically as the C4 carbon-fixation pathway, this process is particularly efficient at high temperature, in bright sunlight, and under dry conditions. Plants using it tend to require less water than those that use the more common C3 carbon-fixation pathway. The seeds may germinate in as little as three days, but the seedlings are slow starters and are easily overwhelmed by weeds. Once established, however, they grow quickly and their maintenance is relatively easy. Kiwicha seems to have daylength sensitivity. As noted, the varieties so far tested in the United States have not grown well, apparently because of daylength incompatibility.",

It usually re-seeds itself. 4 to 6 weeks before last spring frost, direct seed ¼ inch deep, ½ inch apart in rows 8 to 12 inches apart. Make succession plantings from early to midspring. Resume plantings in late summer to midfall for fall and winter harvest. Thin to 2 to 3 inches if harvesting cut-and-come-again style, or 4 to 6 inches if harvesting leaves individually. Unlike most greens, claytonia maintains flavor and quality even when plants flower. Flavor turns bitter in hot weather. Plants may overwinter in Zone 6 and warmer.

Transformer has several stages of development in which the elements of the flower structure change and mature - all of which are excellent for harvesting to use this stunner either fresh or dried. This hardy annual is a definite conversation piece and equally wonderful as a highly desired 'snack stop' for pollinators and beneficial insects. With regular deadheading you can prolong the blooms. Transformer grows 24\" to 28\" inches and is notably prolific to self-sow seeds and return again next season to put on another garden show. Deadheading helps to prolong the flowering season.

        "Notes": "An easily grown plant, black mustard is suited to many types of soils except very heavy clays, it grows best on light sandy loams, or deep rich fertile soils. Succeeds in full sun in a well-drained fertile preferably alkaline soil. Prefers a heavy soil in an open position[16]. Another report says that it prefers a light well-drained soil and some shade in the summer. Black mustard is adapted to a wide variety of climatic conditions, it is often grown in the temperate zone though it is mainly suited to tropical areas, and grown chiefly as a rainfed crop in areas of low or moderate rainfall. Black mustard is often cultivated for its edible seed, though it is going out of favour because it rapidly sheds its seeds once they are ripe and this makes it harder to harvest mechanically than the less pungent brown mustard (Brassica juncea). Preferring a moist habitat, in less than ideal conditions the plant will not grow to its full potential. Hot and sunny weather can cause the leaves to wilt. Recovery is achieved during nighttime hours. Non mycorrhizal.",

Rain was not required for self-burial and self-burial was not impeded by the presence of straw on the soil surface. Germination is inhibited by direct or diffused light. The continuous and widespread use of herbicides for the control of A. fatua has frequently resulted in the evolution of herbicide resistance and A. fatua is listed as the second most herbicide resistance prone weed in the world.

Best propagated from cuttings taken from plants whose leaves have a proven superior aroma/taste (seed-grown plants sometimes have little aroma or flavor) when harvest of leaves for culinary purposes is desired. Leaves with good flavor may be clipped fresh as needed or dried for year-round use. Best leaf flavor usually occurs just prior to flowering.Origanum vulgare plants are primarily sold in commerce today under a number of different cultivar, subspecies or varietal names, each geared toward a specific culinary and/or ornamental usage.

An annual or biennial, its vivid scarlet bracts nearly hide small, greenish flowers and appear to have been dipped in paint. The showy red structures are technically bracts, a type of modified leaf, and not petals. The actual flower petals are rather inconspicuous, although the tip of the sepals are tinged with red as well. May and June are the typical bloom time, but because of its annual or biennial nature, you can see flowers blooming as late as October. Bracts are bright colored, with a yellow green blossom. Best grown in medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun. This species is primarily biennial: basal rosette the first year and flowering stalk the second year, with plant death occurring shortly after seed set and with new seed usually germinating in early fall. Species is also semi-parasitic in that its roots will attach to and absorb some nutrients and water from the roots of certain other plants. A hemiparasitic plant is one that its roots seek out those of host plants, usually grasses, and tap into them for nutrition. If you will be starting Indian Pai",

It produces flowers above ground, but develops the fruit below ground in a process known as geocarpy. There are runner and bunch types. Best in well-drained soils. Adventitious roots sometimes occur, root characteristics vary with soil. Self-pollinating. Require minimum amount of lime. Flowers 3-6 wks after planting. The attractive, low-growing ,yellow pea-like flowers pollinate themselves then produce a ‘peg’ that grows down and away from the plant into the soil from which the peanut seed pod will develop. Not known in a truly wild state. Suitable for tropics, subtropics and warm temperate regions, grown from 40°S to 40°N latitude. Peanut plants thrive in warm climates with full sun and well-drained, light, sandy, loam soil. Plants are not frost-hardy and are best grown in areas with long warm summers.

Some plants overwinter as a low rosette of leaves, while others complete their growth and development within a single year. The underside of the leaves, stems and base of bracts of this plant are covered with dense white woolly hairs. The root system is fibrous and the plant propagates itself by self-seeding. It is usually found in openings, woodlands, coastal dunes, sandy pinelands, roadsides, and disturbed areas. There is no noticeable floral scent, although the foliage often has a balsam-like fragrance. Sweet Everlasting's older scientific name is Gnaphalium obtusifolium (by which it is still commonly referred).",

A. trifida is most prevelant in disturbed sites such as, damp soils, wastelands, uncultivated and cultivated lands (field crops), garden, ditches, roadsides, field margins, constructions sites, etc. It may also be found colonising riverbanks, pastures and grasslands. A. trifida is common in flood plains and rare in low rainfall areas. Pollination is mainly performed by wind.

It is a prolific seed producer and in dense infestations can yield up to 3000 seeds/m2, forming persistent propagule banks within a short period. Thanks to its capability to stick to fur and cloth it disperses to undisturbed areas, where it can remain dormant for extended periods, until vegetation is cleared. This species originates from the Neotropics, from Central America and the West Indies south to about the tropic of Capricorn. It has been introduced to the tropics and subtropics of the world (including some Pacific Islands), where it has become widely naturalized. It is a weed of roadsides and cultivation, pastures, rangelands, grasslands, open woodlands, riverbanks, floodplains, coastal regions, disturbed sites, and waste areas. In India, it is found along rail tracks and roadsides, in foothills of open forests, forest clearings, and on wasteland particularly on arid and rocky substrates. It occurs at altitudes ranging from 0 to 1600 m. Vegetative growth in H. suaveolens begins either from rootstocks or seeds. Growth is rapid, and flowering can start at an early age of 2-3 months.

        "Notes": "Small semi-viny annual herb adapted to moist sandy soils and cooler climates. Seed will regenerate each year, germinating in mid to late autumn after rain. With early rain, it can produce a large quantity of forage before winter. It grows slowly during winter, making its best growth after spring rain, when it flowers and seeds before dying in the heat of summer. Serradella seed has been traditionally sown as pod segments, in which the pod itself constitutes three quarters of the pod weight. Podded seed is very hard and little will germinate unless scarified through a dehulling machine. If the pod trash is not cleaned from the seed, it acts as a filler, making planting easier. The rhizobium for serradella does not occur naturally in the soil and has to be introduced with the seed at sowing. Inoculate pods or seed with Group G (lupin-serradella) inoculum which seems to nodulate serradella plants effectively on soils of pH 5.5-7.5. A new 'super serradella' inoculant has been developed for use on soils of lower pH. Serradella persists well under continuous grazing, with a carrying capacity of 1.5 to 3 wethers per hectare, or for cattle one adult beast per three hectares depending on se",

It is usually in flower and producing seed in all months of the year. This species is a prime example of how a plant can be viewed as an annoying weed in some areas of the world whilst in others it is actually cultivated for its wide range of uses, . The plant is extensively cultivated in some areas of the world as a cabbage-flavoured spring greens, in Japan it is one of the essential ingredients of a ceremonial rice and barley gruel that is eaten on January 7th. The leaves grow rather larger under cultivation, they can be harvested about a month after sowing and can be treated as a cut and come again crop[206]. They do run to seed fairly rapidly, however, especially in hot dry weather or when in poor soils. A member of the cabbage family, it is a host plant for many diseases of Brassica.",

Carduus pycnocephalus (Italian thistle) is a winter annual forb (family Asteraceae) widely distributed in disturbed open sites, roadsides, pastures, annual grasslands, and waste areas in much of California. Disturbed sites such as: fallow fields, margins of cultivated fields, irrigation canals, roadsides, fire breaks, landsides, feral pig rooting, grazed heavily, and canyon bottoms are areas of establishment. Italian thistle can grow densely, crowding out other vegetation with dense rosette 'colonies' in the winter, thereby preventing establishment of native plants. Its spiny leaves, stems, and phyllaries prevent animals from grazing on it and nearby forage Its tendency to grow under the canopy of oaks increases the risk of wildfire damage to the trees, as fire can more easily spread to the canopy. Populations are maintained annually by a majority of seed that fall within a few meters of the population each year. Long distance wind dispersal allows for new satellite populations to form.",

Nicotiana alata, commonly called flowering tobacco or winged tobacco, is native from southern Brazil to northeastern Argentina. It is a somewhat spindly plant that typically grows 3-5’ tall and features nocturnally fragrant, long-tubed, yellowish-green to white flowers that open only at night. Spatulate basal leaves to 12” long are attached by distinctive winged petioles (alata means winged). Upper stem leaves are much smaller and sessile. Species plants are rarely available except from seed, having been replaced by compact cultivars (to 2’ tall) which feature mostly non-fragrant flowers that open during the day in a variety of colors including red, pink, lime-green and white. The common flowering tobacco compact hybrids (N. alata x N. forgetiana) sold in cell/six packs by nurseries are classified as N. x sanderae (e.g., see Domino, Havana, Merlin, Metro and Starship Series). Seed is perhaps best sown indoors 6-8 weeks before last frost date, but may be sown directly in the garden af",
