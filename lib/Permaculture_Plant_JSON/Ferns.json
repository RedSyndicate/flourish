HABITAT: Habitat Woodland margins, often by stream, sparsely vegetated land, wetlands, woodland, & forest. Most preferred habitats sparsely vegetated landwetlandswoodland and forest. May also occur in heathland and shrub. The name chain fern refers to the arrangement of the sori. These are located close to the midrib of the frond lobes and are formed of elongated segments resembling a chain of sausages. PROPAGATION: Spores, Plantlets, Division in spring. Propagules adapted to wind and water dispersal. Resistant to Honey Fungus. This large imposing evergreen fern needs space to grow and rich humus woodland soil in shade. On mature plants bulbils form towards the end of the fronds - where these touch the ground they produce new plants. Slow to propagate.",

It is probably the easiest of the Cystopteris species to identify: fronds widest at the base and most with a long taper to a slender tip (especially later in the season), veins terminate in the notches between lobes/teeth, pinnae undersides with scattered bulblets and variously covered in glandular hairs, more densely so near the tip of the frond. The bright red to maroon stems of young plants are also quite distinctive. This medium-small fern is unique because of the bulblets that form on the underside of its leaves. Aside from this unusual method of asexual reproduction, the Bulblet Fern is similar in appearance to other Cystopteris spp. (Bladder Ferns) and their hybrids. The bulblets will drop from the leaves and grow and produce new plants under favorable conditions. The leaves grow from a rhizome growing at or below the ground. The long leaves make this a favorite in rock gardens. Grows most commonly on damp, shady, calcareous rocks.",

The familiar \"fiddleheads\" also emerge from the base of the plant and unfurl into large, erect, pinnately-compound, yellowish-green, sterile fronds (2-4' long) which remain attractive throughout the summer and turn yellow in autumn. The common name of this plant is in reference to the cinnamon-colored fibers found near the frond bases. It is easily grown in medium to wet soils in part shade to full shade. Prefers moist, rich, humusy, acidic soils, but adapts to lesser conditions. The root system consists of a crown of fibrous roots, from which spreading rhizomes are occasionally produced. This plant has compact, horizontal rhizome, its growth is vigorous. It may go dormant with dry soil. Both sterile and fertile cinnamon fern fronds expand during a short period in early spring.

Giant Chain Fern has been found in Texada and Vancouver Islands in British Columbia, and in the Puget Sound region of Washington where it is listed as sensitive. It is more common from southern Oregon and California to northwest Mexico, mostly near the coast, but can also be found inland in Arizona and Nevada. Native to the forests of the west coast of North America, it's the largest fern in North America. Its long fronds reach up to 8 feet in length. Its sori are short but broad and are arranged in neat lines (the characteristic that gives the chain ferns their name). The chain shape is visible on both surface & underside of each leaflet. It can be either evergreen or summer deciduous, depending on its growing conditions. Slight fragrance. Biomes/Growing conditions: Deer Resistance, Mesic, Oregon Coast, Western Native. Highly deer resistant. HABITAT: Mild, wet coastal forests. Sometimes found growing on seepy coastal cliffs or in desert areas near shady seeps. Moist areas near saltwater. Wetland designation: FACW, it usually occurs in wetlands, but is occasionally found in non-wetlands. Fronds grow upright or slightly bent, from",

RANGE: Europe - Norway to Spain, east to Ukraine and Greece; Asia - Caucasus, Turkey, Lebanon; Africa - Morocco to Tunisia; N. America - Alaska to California. HABITATS: Woods, heaths, moors, mountain grassland and on rocks; at ELEVATIONS to 3,937 feet. Wet coniferous woods & swamps, primarily along the coast & in coastal mountain ranges; at elevations to 4,953 feet in western N. America. Although cold tolerant, young growth in spring can be badly damaged by late frosts. A calcifuge plant, it prefers a moist shady nook in the rock garden or a position in open woodland in a moist soil. A polymorphic & very ornamental species, there are several named varieties. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer. PROPAGATION: Spores, Plantlets, Division in spring. Propagules adapted to wind & water dispersal. Resistant to Honey Fungus. This large imposing evergreen fern needs space to grow & rich humus woodland soil in shade. On mature plants bulbils form towards the end of the fronds; where these touch the ground they produce new plants.",

They grow on tropical rainforest trees as epiphytes which collect water & organic matter in their bowl-shaped rosettes. HABITATS: Cliffs, dark forests, & tree trunks. IUCN endangered species in its native habitats. - They get their name from their very unfernlike fronds—they’re simple & tongue-shaped rather than deeply cut like most fern fronds—& because they form an open, cuplike rosette much like a bird’s nest. Similar species: A. nidus & A. australasicum. ELEVATION: To 2,500 feet. PROPAGATION: By spores or from tissue culture. HABITAT: Bird’s-nest ferns are essentially epiphytes (plants that grow on tree trunks & branches), they’re also found on rock faces & sometimes fall to the ground & continue growing as terrestrial plants.",

        "Notes": "Osmunda regalis, commonly called royal fern, is a tall, deciduous, native fern which usually occurs on moist bluffs and ledges and along streams (sometimes growing in the water). Habitat: wet, acidic swamps, bogs. Distribution: Europe and northern Africa, eastern North America. Typically grows in clumps to 5-6' tall, but with constant moisture can reach 6' in height. Broad fronds have large, well-separated pinnae (leaflets) which give this fern an almost pea-family appearance. Fronds typically turn yellow to brown in autumn. Spores are located in brown, tassel-like, fertile clusters at the tips of the fronds, thus giving rise to the additional common name of flowering fern for this plant. It is best grown in medium to wet soils in part shade. It prefers moist, rich, humusy, acidic soils, but adapts to lesser conditions. Also prefers cool summer climates where it tolerates close to full sun as long as given consistent moisture. Full sun exposure is not recommended. At suitable locations, this fern is long-lived (up to 100 years), but it develops and spreads slowly.",
