All Ceratophyllum species are obligately submerged aquatics and cannot tolerate periods of emergence. C. demersum is a cosmopolitan submerged aquatic species that has probably already invaded most of its potential exotic range. It has the advantages of being a perennial surviving well overwinter in deeper water and by growing both by asexual reproduction of broken or complete stems and by sexual reproduction of very many seeds. It has a wide ecological tolerance and grows relatively fast. Disturbance of the water body results in increases in growth through changes in nutrient availability but also in faster dispersal around water bodies allowing greater competition with less vigorous species. In general, C. demersum occurs in quiet or slow flowing, hard calcareous, nutrient-rich or eutrophic waters of streams, ditches ,canals, ponds and lakes as a near free-floating aquatic plant where it may form large masses. It is especially favoured by nitrate-rich conditions where it grows in greater abundance. It is a cosmopolitan species. Although the plant is considered rootless,",

Pontederia cordata is a native aquatic plant of the eastern half of the United States and Canada.The thick rhizomes spread to form large colonies. Its preference is for freshwater depth up to 12 inches in full sun in rich loamy soils. It can tolerate part sun, poor soils and occasional flooding up to 20 inches. The tall spikes of lavender-blue flowers occur summer through fall and attract many pollinators. They are held well above the water for a showy long season display. Winter dormant. Blooms spring to fall. The root system consists of long-running rhizomes and coarse fibrous roots. Clonal colonies are often produced; sometimes, they can become quite large. Individual plants short-lived but it spreads vegetatively to form long-lived patches.",

It is one of the true rushes. It has a nearly cosmopolitan distribution, being found in many places around the world, but primarily in cool-temperate regions, particularly ones having wet soils. It is often found growing in ditches, bogs, swamps, marshes, wet pastures, and along the margins of lakes and rivers. Easily grown in moist to wet soils in full sun to part shade. Best in full sun. Performs well in standing water to 4” deep, but will also grow well in garden soils as long as the soils are in fact kept consistently moist. Plants will spread in the landscape by rhizomes and by self-seeding. The root system consists of short scaly rhizomes and coarse fibrous roots. Rhizomatous spread may be controlled, if desired, by growing this plant in large containers sunk in the ground.",

Path rush is found in a wide variety of weedy locations such as in parking lots, fields, thickets, woods, swamps, pastures and along roadsides and paths. Also called wire grass (even though it is a rush) because of its tough stems. Path Rush is a cool-season plant; it actively grows during the spring and fall when soil temperatures are cool. Typical growing conditions include full sun to light shade, wet to mesic levels of moisture, and a heavy clay-loam, clay, or gravelly soil. This rush withstands considerable trampling in paths and compacted soil. It is more tolerant of drought than many other rushes. Medium green leaves turn brown with frost. Insignificant, tiny flowers are clustered at or near the stem tips. The blooming period usually occurs during the summer; however, 1st year plants may bloom later during the fall. The flowers are wind-pollinated. The root system is fibrous.",

Leaf matter extends up to 40 cm above the water surface and the interwoven mat of roots and stems can sink to 50 cm into the water (EPPO, 2005). Stipules are present. Leaves are reniform in shape, non sclerophyllous, less than 1 mm thick and vary in size from 20-45 mm to 100-150 mm, depending on nitrate availability, and have shallow-lobed edges. Flower stalks also derive from the nodes. The species produces very small creamy yellow flowers approximately 3 mm in diameter on a short umbel below the leaf canopy. Each umbel averages nine flowers . Fruit are ovoid-ellipsoid to suborbicular, strongly flattened dorsally; mericarps with three subequal ribs; fruit wall a woody inner layer.

        "Notes": "Berula erecta (stream parsnip) is a member of the carrot family & is an aquatic & herbaceous perennial stolon-forming species. Widespread across much of Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia, & North America. South West of England, especially in Devon. - HABITAT: Cold headwater streams and seeps within a variety of non-forested and forested wetlands, including prairie fens, southern wet meadow, southern shrub-carr, rich tamarack swamp, hardwood-conifer swamp, and rich conifer swamp. Poorly drained neutral & acidic soils of the lowlands & upland fringe. Shallow aquatic environments containing moderate nutrient levels. - During the winter, its stem and body become completely submerged underwater. It has a hollow stem. Underwater leaves consist of compound with thread-like lobes; leaves above the surface of the water are flatter and broader. The stems are usually stoloniferous, rooting at the nodes, the plant often forming large colonies. Requires a mostly open canopy. PROPAGATION: By sowing & broken fragments that colonize banks by drifting downstream. It will root readily in shallow pond water. Simply cover the roots with pebbles to keep the plant upright.",
