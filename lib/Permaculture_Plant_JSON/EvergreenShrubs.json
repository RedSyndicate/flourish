Single specimens may fruit poorly. This shrub is evergreen in the warm winter climates of USDA Zones 8-10. In the St. Louis area, it is considered to be semi-evergreen to deciduous because plants will typically lose their foliage (become deciduous) as soon as winter temperatures dip below 10 degrees F., with the stems sometimes dying to the ground. Plants are not reliably winter hardy to the St. Louis area, and if grown therein, should be sited in protected locations with organic winter mulches applied.

Leaves alternate, simple, small, to 2-2.5 cm, stiff, holly-like, ending in 1-6 spiny teeth, shiny dark green above, pale yellow-green beneath. Flowers showy, abundant, bright yellow-orange tinged with red, in 10 cm clusters, appear on reddened stalks in spring. Fruit blue, dark purple or plum red, round, waxy, 6 mm long. Spreads by underground runners to form a thicket. Native to Chile and Argentina. Once it is established it can be quite drought and heat tolerant and it is resistant to browsing by deer. To maintain its shape, prune it only to remove dead, broken or poorly formed branches.",

It is a large evergreen upright tropical shrub that will grow to 10-15’ tall in its native habitat. Flowers feature numerous bushy bright red stamens in rounded to cylindrical spikes (to 4” long) that resemble bottlebrushes. Flowers bloom intermittently throughout the year in frost-free areas. Leaves have a lemony scent when bruised. Lemon bottlebrush is commonly grown as a shrub, or as a single-trunked standard tree. It is a tough, reliable evergreen species, with red brush-like flowers in hanging clusters. The leaves smell lemon-like when crushed, hence the common name. It may require regularly scheduled light top-trimming (but not necessarily shearing) of vigorous top shoots to maintain its height below 25 feet. ffered as a shrub, bottlebrush can be trained as a tree to 15-feet or espaliered as a quick wall cover. It makes a nice screen or tall unclipped hedge. Pruning to develop several trunks and removing some lower branches can create a fine small specimen tree.",

It is also found in KwaZulu-Natal and Mpumalanga. It shows remarkable variation within its distribution. Lessertia frutescens is fast growing and easy to grow, but short-lived as a garden subject. It is a tough, hardy plant that does well in full sun and tolerates all soil types. It occurs both in summer and winter rainfall regions, and is quite drought-tolerant so does not require much watering. Interacts adversely with antiretroviral drugs. These species form a bird pollinated group in Lessertia. Sunbirds pollinate the attractive butterfly-like red flowers. The lightweight, papery, inflated pods enable the seed to be dispersed easily by wind. The cancer bush seeds itself readily, and grows easily from seed. Sow in autumn or spring in well-drained soil. Germination is improved if seeds are left to soak for about 4 hours or overnight in water hot enough for you to put your hand in. The plants are short-lived but they s",

        "Notes": "Coleonema are evergreen shrubs with tiny, needle-like leaves & small, star-shaped flowers. The densely-packed foliage is aromatic. Origin: South Africa - SA Distribution: Western Cape. - At the base of rocky cliffs on mostly south-facing slopes. It occurs naturally on the sandstone & limestone mountain slopes from Worcester, Caledon to Bredasdorp, at an altitude of 16-3,937 feet. C. juniperinum is a distinct species with small white flowers, 3-4 mm diam., the smallest in the genus; with petals pappilose; with slender filiform branchlets & small leaves showing only two rows of gland dots. Shrublet to 1.75 feet. Sprawling. RANGE: S. Africa: Bokkeveld to Riviersonderend Mtns. Mainly found in the Caledon & Worcester divisions & concentrates towards the south western corner of this area. There is an extraordinary disjunction towards the north, a distance of about 130 kilometres, before the species reappears between Clanwilliam & Nieuwoudtville in a much more arid environment. HABITAT: Sandstone & shale slopes.",

The buchu is finely branched, light & wispy with small soft needle-like fragrant foliage that densely clothes the many branches. Origin: South Africa - SA Distribution: Western Cape. Saldanha Bay to the Cape Peninsula & as far east as Bredasdorp. A coastal plant, that withstands strong coastal winds where it thrives. Grows amongst outcrops of rocks of the Table Mountain Sandstone series, or of the underlying Cape granite, but never on the coastal limestone of the Bredasdorp Series. ALTITUDE: Sea level to 2,461 feet on Table Mountain. There's a pink flowering species Coleonema pulchellum, a compact form of this species. Coleonema pulchellum 'Compact Form' & a golden foliage form Coleonema pulchellum 'Sunset Gold'. Heather is considered a drought tolerant plant once established, but only to a point. They must never completely dry out. PROPAGATION: Fruit is 5-lobed & ripe seed are ejected by a catapult mechanism. Cuttings have the advantage of producing a larger flowering plant quicker than seedlings.",

Of course, the seedlings would not be a problem in a street tree planting or in an area such as a lawn or highway median, which is mowed regularly. Though the crushed leaves and green twigs give off a delicious maraschino cherry fragrance, they are quite bitter and possibly poisonous. Root systems are often quite shallow, but usually they are not aggressive and do not cause problems. Preferring ample moisture while young, Cherry-Laurel is otherwise well suited to sun or shade locations on any average, well-drained soil. Once established, Cherry-Laurel is salt- and drought-tolerant, requiring little or no irrigation. Over-irrigating can cause chlorosis and death. Do not plant in wet, soggy areas. The tree adapts well to soils with high pH. Clay soil is fine as long as water doesn’t stand after rain. Propagation is by seeds, by cuttings, or by digging seedlings, which appear in great numbers around mature plants.",

DISTRIBUTION & HABITAT: Chironia krebsii grows in the mist belt along the whole length of the Escarpment. In South Africa it is distributed in the Eastern Cape, Free State, Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal, Limpopo & Mpumalanga Provinces. It is not endemic to South Africa as it also occurs naturally in Malawi, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Mauritania & Reunion. Its natural habitat is marshy soil, usually at high altitudes. permanently damp, seepage areas or beside a stream or pond. It occurs most often in marshes in high-altitude grasslands (8143 feet), rarely in coastal grasslands. After fertilization, it produces narrowly ovoid capsules. PROPAGATION: All Chironia species, can be propagated by cuttings as well as seeds. Propagation by cuttings should take place around autumn. Using tip cuttings or a little softer material will enable the cuttings to root faster. The cuttings should be treated with rooting hormone & placed in a propagating unit with heated beds & intermittent mist. Sow seed in spring or early summer, use a sterile sowing medium. Keep warm & moist. The time of flowering is summer.",

Cultivated plants take about 5 years to come into full bearing but will then crop well for 60 - 100 years. Dislikes root disturbance, plants are best grown in pots until being planted out in their permanent positions. the pl;ant has both an erect stem om which the fruiting occurs and trailing stems which form a dense rooted mat so can be said to have a vining habit. Cranberry bog soil is unique in that it consists of alternating layers of sand and organic matter. Dead leaves accumulate over the course of time and sand is added to the bed surface every 2-5 years to encourage upright production and maintain productivity. In contrast to normal agricultural soils, cranberry soil requires no tilling, remains undisturbed over time, and little mixing of sand and organic matter occurs. As a wetland-adapted plant, cranberries are tolerant of flooded soils. However, during the active growing season (generally from March through October), good drainage in the soil is essential to proper root growth and function. During that part of the season,",

May spread to as much as 10-12’. It is native to mountainous areas of southeastern Siberia. Feathery, soft-textured, scalelike (infrequently awl-shaped) foliage is arranged in flat, fan-like sprays reminiscent of arborvitae (Thuja). Plants also resemble in habit some of the horizontal junipers. Foliage is bright green in summer changing to bronze-purple in fall and winter. Fruits are tiny, spherical, berry-like cones (to 1/4” diameter) with woody-like scales. Needs good drainage as it is subject to root rot. Propagation is by cuttings.",

        "Notes": "Native to Florida, the West Indies, and South America Normally seen as a shrub, fiddlewood can grow to about 35 feet tall in its native habitat in south Florida. Leaves are unusually glossy with smooth margins and a distinctive bowed venation pattern. The plant produces several trunks which if left untrained, eventually gives rise to a multi-stemmed shrub or small tree. Small, white showy flowers produced in the summer months contrast nicely with the shiny foliage. Young plants can be upright and rounded; older specimens develop a rounded vase form with lower branches removed.",

B. prionitis has the potential to grow in a wide range of climates and soil types. Additionally, it is adapted to grow in open, full sunny areas and in highly disturbed sites as well as in the understory of secondary forests. In Puerto Rico it flowers from September to December and fruits are produced from January to April. In China, it has been recorded flowering from October to December and fruiting from December to February. In Australia, the flowering season occurs from April to May. Prefers a position in full sun or partial shade and a fertile, moist but well-drained soil. It can be considered an annual or perennial plant. During the dry season its stems, leaves, and flowers die off but the roots remain alive. Central taproot, with lateral roots. The vegetation regrows during the rainy season.",

In SA it is distributed across the Provinces of the Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal, Mpumalanga and Limpopo. HABITAT: Forest & on forest margins. Adapts well in tropical & warm temperate climates. The name Rhoicissus is derived from the Greek rhoia, meaning ‘pomegranate’ and kissos, ‘ivy’. Perhaps not the most accurate of names: like ivy, it's a climber, but it has tendrils; & the small fruits, although spherical, do not seem very like that of a pomegranate. The species name rhomboidea is derived from the Latin rhombus, meaning ‘a four-sided geometric figure with all sides equal & the opposite angles are equal’, referring to the diamond-shaped leaves. The species was first described in 1859, treated under Cissus. Propagation: Use primings as stem and tip cuttings. Trim each one to give about 2.5 cm (1 inch) of stem below the bottom of three leaves. Dip the end into hormone rooting powder. Insert five to seven cuttings",

Established plants are drought resistant and are also lime tolerant, and are hardy to at least 5°f. A dioecious species - both male and female forms must be grown if fruit and seed are required. Propagation: Seed - best sown as soon as it's ripe in the autumn in a greenhouse. It can also be sown in spring in a greenhouse in a sandy compost. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots as soon as they are large enough to handle and grow them on for at least their first winter in a greenhouse. Plant out in the spring or early summer after the last expected frosts & give protection in their first winter. Division in spring or autumn. Layering. A prominent underground tap root system with many adventitious roots is present in Ephedra. Spread by the use of rhizomes. Can't grow in shade. NM=non-arbuscular mycorrhiza.

Grow in moist, acidic, humusy, somewhat lean, sandy or gravelly, very well-drained soils of average fertility in full sun to part shade. Plants perform best in full sun (better flowering), but may appreciate some part afternoon light shade in hot summer climates. Scotch heather prefers a moist and cool climate. It generally dislikes the high heat/humidity of the Midwest and deep South and is not recommended for planting south of USDA Zone 6. It also dislikes heavy clay soils. Plants need regular and consistent moisture and should not be allowed to dry out. Do not site plants in locations exposed to strong winds. Mulch with peat moss. Avoid cultivating around plants because they have shallow root systems. Prune in spring before new growth appears. Older shrubs often become leggy and unkempt, and appreciate an annual spring pruning. C. vulgaris varies from low-lying matlike forms to upright ball-shaped bushes and dwarf trees, depending on its environment. It generally grows 0.5– 1.25 m tall and is an evergreen perennial shrub with woody, pliable stems.",

Common juniper is almost completely circumpolar within the exception of a gap in the Bering Sea region . It is widespread in North America beyond the northern limit of trees, occurring from western Alaska and British Columbia to Newfoundland, Greenland, and Iceland. Common juniper extends southward through New England to the Carolinas and westward through northeastern Illinois, Indiana, northern Ohio, Minnesota, and Nebraska to the western mountains of Washington, California, Arizona, and New Mexico. Common juniper is a native, evergreen shrub or columnar tree. Throughout most of North America, common juniper most often grows as a low, decumbent mat-forming shrub reaching up to 4.9 feet (1.5 m) in height and 7.6 to 13.1 feet (2-4 m) across. In parts of New England common juniper occasionally grows up to 25 feet (7.6 m) in height, and a treelike growth form is reportedly common in Europe. Height at maturity can range from 2 to 50 feet (0.6-15.3 m). At polar limits, common juniper grows as a dwarf shrub in forest tundra.",

The seed has a hard seedcoat and can be very slow to germinate, requiring a cold period followed by a warm period and then another cold spell, each of 2 - 3 months duration. Soaking the seed for 3 - 6 seconds in boiling water may speed up the germination process. The seed is best sown as soon as it is ripe in a cold frame. Some might germinate in the following spring, though most will take another year. Another possibility is to harvest the seed 'green' (when the embryo has fully formed but before the seedcoat has hardened).

Prune if needed after bloom in late summer.Semi-evergreen leaves persist to late fall. Kalm St. John's Wort has a wide soil tolerance, but prefers rich sandy loams that are well-drained. Tolerant of proximity to black walnut trees. The plant prefers full sun, wet to moist conditions, and well-drained soil containing calcareous sand or limestone. Shallow water is tolerated if it is temporary. It also tolerates a range of soil types, drought, and dry soil. It is endemic to the Great Lakes Region. Habitats include interdunal swales, borders of small sandy ponds, moist to wet sandy meadows, and moist sand flats (pannes).",

Common in plains and scrub jungles along river banks upto 900m.India, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Burma, Malaysia.. The stems are armed with simple or branched, sharp spines. The plant is a sprawling semi-vine shrub. Leaves are 1-3 inches long, very dark green, shiny and opposite and they have large spines. If the leaves or stems are injured, the white milky sap is seen, which is characteristic of this group of plants. The flowers are small, fragrant, white in colour and about 3.5 inches long, with rose colour stalk. The fruits are small and purplish to black in colour. The fruit size is variable, but most fruits are about 3.5 inch in diameter with a few seeds. Fruits usually occur in clusters somewhat resembling large purple grapes. Regular plantations of Karonda can be trained on single or double stem. Therefore additional unwanted shoots or laterals are removed from time-to-time to give the plant desired shape. Bearing plants of normal height do not require any pruning. Suckers arising from ground and diseased dried twigs should be removed. Since karaunda is a hardy plant, it requires very little care.

L. camara has a wide environmental tolerance and occurs in a variety of habitats. These include wastelands, rainforest edges and beachfronts. It also grows well in disturbed areas such as roads, railways and areas recovering from fire or logging. In its native neo tropical habitat Flowering and fruiting take place throughout the year with a peak during the first two months of the rainy season. In addition to spread by seed, L. camara is able to produce adventitious shoots, especially shallow lateral roots, following mechanical damage. Hence, it is also able to spread and establish dense thickets by vegetative means. The capacity of the species to spread vegetatively and to inhibit both the growth of other vegetation and seed germination, in conjunction with heavy and regular fruiting, is the main reason why L. camara forms long-lasting permanent thickets. In areas where natural fires occur they stimulate thicker regrowth.",

It was introduced into the U.S. by Frank Meyer who reportedly found the plant in 1908 near Peking, China. It is believed to be a hybrid cross of C. limon (lemon) and C. reticulata (mandarin orange). It is less acidic, juicier and sweeter than common lemons. Trees typically grow to 6-10’ tall. Shiny dark green leaves are evergreen.",

Arctostaphylos parryana is a variable, evergreen shrub that can be prostrate, erect, or mound-forming. Propagation: Seed - best sown in a greenhouse as soon as it is ripe. Arctostaphylos seeds, especially if not sown fresh, are generally stimulated into germinating by one of two methods. The most effective is fire passing quickly over seeds that are lying dormant in the soil - this breaks down their surface coat allowing them to imbibe moisture when it next rains and then germinate. Alternatively, stomach acids act upon the seed coat when the fruit is eaten by various animals - the seed frequently passes through the gut unharmed and is deposited in a convenient pile of nutrients when the animal defecates - the seed will often still benefit from a period of winter cold before germinating in the spring. Both of these methods can be somewhat reproduced by the gardener - the seed can be placed under some straw which is then set alight - both seeds and ashes should be sown. Alternatively, pouring a small amount of nearly boiling water on the seeds (being careful not to cook them!) and then soa",

Although until recently all tested Velloziaceae were described as desiccation-tolerant, recent studies provided evidence for a continuum of morphofunctional attributes, resulting in strategies to cope with drought that range from DT to non-desiccation tolerance. Velloziaceae form rosettes with a caudex surrounded by ae\u0002rial roots that grow to reach the substrate. These aerial roots are covered by persistent leaf sheaths that help retain moisture and allow for direct shoot-water uptake.",

Like most prostantheras it prefers a well drained, moist position with some shelter from direct summer sun. Under dry conditions it will wilt noticeably but quickly recovers when watered. It is a good \"indicator\" of when watering is required in a garden generally. Propagation: Seed - sow spring in a greenhouse.The seed usually germinates within a few weeks. When they are large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter.

It does not form root tubers. The plant is sometimes harvested from the wild for local use as a food and medicine. It is often grown as an ornamental in gardens and as a pot plant in cooler climates; there is a wide range of cultivated forms, valued especially for their wide range of variegated leaves. Flowers are small, blue-violet, in slender, terminal clusters, and irregularly shaped. Blue-white two lipped nettle-like flowers appear in racemes, early summer to fall but are not showy and can distract from the leaves. The flowers are insignificant. The calyx of the flower is persistent and resembles a saucer hence the Latin name \"scutella.\" Stems can be semi-succulent and light green, making them stand out from the leaves. This plant has 4-angled stems. This plant is grown for its multi-colored foliage. Too much sun will cause plants to wilt, too much shade causes them to become leggy. It is easily grown from stem cuttings in potting soil or a glass of water. Tolerates, or benefits from, cultivation...",

Week root system- may require staking. Can re-sprout after damage. Roots may cause surface interference. Needles fall in too much shade. Even in Florida, these trees are subject to frost damage and produce multiple stems with weakly attached trunks - in the 2004 hurricane season, many of these trees failed under the 160 km/h winds. As a result some coastal communities (e.g. Vero Beach) prohibit their use as a tree in local landscape plan approvals because of the danger posed by falling trunks. Many of the \"Norfolk Island pines\" growing in Hawaii, including their descendants growing as potted ornamentals on the U.S. mainland, are actually Cook pines, the two species having been confused when introduced.",

        "Notes": "This plant, which grows in a wild state in central and southwestern China, is doubtless the most cold-resistant of all the evergreen species in the orange subfamily. It differs greatly from the other species in the subgenus Papeda in having large flowers, and large, very thick seeds. The leaves also differ in having extremely long but rather narrow winged petioles, often exceeding in area the slender, pointed, lanceolate leaf blades. Citrus cavaleriei has long been cultivated in China, especially as a stock for more edible cultivars. An important factor in the hardiness of this species is the ripening of its wood, which is helped by hot summers. When ripening is successful it can survive temperatures below –18 ºC, but around –10 ºC may be about its limit in areas with cooler summers. The Ichang papeda's main claim to fame is its unusual hardiness. With the exception of the Trifoliate orange Citrus trifoliata it is the hardiest citrus plant, tolerating both moderate frost and damp conditions. For this reason, it is perhaps the only species of true citrus which can be reliably grown outside in the temperate areas of Europe and the United States. This is the hardiest member of the Cit",

According to Iseli nursery, it is a \"bizarrely attractive collector's plant.\" Typical rate of growth for this cultivar is 12 to 18 inches (30 - 45 cm) per year, obviously producing a very large specimen in very short order. It tends to grow upward for only a few feet (1 m) before knuckling over and hugging the ground. However, 'Uncle Fogy' is very forgiving of staking and aggressive pruning which helps to contain it and can allow for very artistic presentation. This cultivar originated as a wild-collected seedling found in the 1960s by A.G. Johnson and later planted in the home garden of Mrs. Wylder of Richfield, Minnesota.",

Site in locations protected from strong winds. During the growing season, it does best in consistently moist soils, but established plants are quite tolerant of some drought. When overwintering as a houseplant, bring indoors before first fall frost to a bright sunny room. Cut back stems hard in late winter to encourage new growth for the coming season. When overwintering as a dormant plant, cut stems back and store in a cool, dry, dark corner of a basement or frost-free garage. May be easily grown from seed, but plants generally will not flower until the second year. Plumbago auriculata is easily propagated from seed, cuttings and suckers. Sow seed in spring in seedling trays. Use good seedling mix and cover the seeds lightly. Do not allow to dry out. The easiest method of propagation is to remove rooted suckers from the mother plant. Plumbago auriculata will flower profusely after being cut back or after a growth flush, as it bears flowers on new wood. It may need to be cut back after winter to keep it tidy, even if this is only done ever",

He relates that it is now gathered by means of a Aasavronjpmv or kind of flail with which the plants are threshed. When these thongs are loaded with the fiagrant and sticky resin they are scraped with a knife. The substance is then roiled into a mass, in which state'it is called ladanum or labdanum.",

An excellent choice for coastal gardens, as it prefers light, well-drained soil and full sun, tolerates strong winds, and is drought resistant. It's capable of re-sprouting from its rootstock. It recovers from frost damage, but prefers a warm sheltered spot in a frosty area. For more prolific growth, water well and give it plenty of compost/mulch. Prune to keep the plant shapely, but with age, usually after about five years or more, a build-up of wood is inevitable. At this point it is better to start afresh with a young plant. Also called Brown Salvia, it is easily propagated by stem cuttings, or seed sown in spring. Seedlings will flower from a year to 18 months after sowing.",

The undersides of the leaves are white and are covered with fine hairs much like Lamb's Ear. The plant is propagated by softwood cuttings during the summer, root ball division in the spring, or sowing seeds in late spring. In ancient times its leaves were used as lamp wicks. It tolerates strong pruning and should be trimmed before flowering in spring to maintain a compact shape.

Leaves are formed opposite each other along the stems or on short side branches, and often grow in tufts. The bright green leaves are slightly hairy and sometimes the edges are toothed. Individual plants flower for a month or two. The flowers are on small side branches; opening from the bottom upwards towards the tips of the stems. The large calyx is usually an attractive reddish-purple colour. It is covered with small hairs and is also dotted with glands. The corolla, which we usually call the flower, varies in colour from blue, mauve, pink to pure white. Flowers with a dark blue top lip and white lower lip.

It is primarily a boreal species occurring throughout much of Alaska and Canada, although it extends into the Great Lakes and the northeastern United States. White spruce typically occurs in cold regions in riparian, upland, and treeline sites. It is the dominant tree species of the dry, usually upland North American boreal forest region. It grows best on well-drained soils but occurs on a wide range of land forms and soil types, with many different associates, in various regional contexts. Monoecious. Needle rust, canker, yellow headed spruce sawfly are problems. Not tolerate of atmospheric pollution. Seed production begins after appx. 20 years. Seed production is vary variable, with mast years every 10-12 years. Happiest in fertile, well-drained soils. White spruce commonly lives 100 to 250 years.",

        "Notes": "This cultivar originated as a witch's broom found in 1994 by the late Gary Lanham near Lebanon, Kentucky. The broom was nearly 10 feet high in a mature Picea abies. Intrigued by the interesting beehive form, Gary took it to Klein's Nursery in Louisville, and from there, it made its way to Iseli Nursery where it went into production and introduced to the nursery trade. Picea abies 'Lanham's Beehive' is a dense multi-stemmed selection of Norway spruce with a shapely oval form. Its relatively fine texture sets it apart from other landscape plants with less-refined foliage. The needles of 'Lanham's Beehive' are longer and thicker than other dwarf cultivars and they have a slight glaucous tint. These features, combined with prominent, cinnamon-colored stems and buds, create a dramatic effect in the garden. After 10 years of growth, a mature specimen will measure 16 inches (40 cm) tall and 28 inches (70 cm) wide, an annual growth rate of 1 to 2 inches (2.5 - 5 cm). It tends to fill out right to the ground and therefore doesn't necessarily require facer plants in front. It grows at a slow rate, and under ideal conditions can be expected to live for 50 years or more.",

This plant is common in coastal areas in the Australian states of New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and possibly into South Australia where it grows on sand dunes and cliffs; there it is called Coast Tea Tree. The plant is able to propagate quickly post-fire, which contributes to its invasive ability. Australian myrtle flowers during spring in its second or third year, producing small white flowers.

Many forms are found in cultivation including red-flowered, pink-flowered, double-flowered, prostrate and dwarf forms. n the past in New Zealand, hill country farmers (and to some extent governments) have spent much time and effort in controlling manuka, which tends to spring up in large numbers when land is cleared for pastoral agriculture. Besides the lost production from its direct effects on pasture, costs have included hand slashing, mechanized clearing and herbicides used in attempts to maintain pastures clear of manuka. However, because of the increasing economic value of manuka honey, large blocks of land in New Zealand are currently being planted in manuka.

Best growth typically occurs in dry to medium moisture well-drained soils in full sun to light shade. Although drought tolerant, shrubs prefer moderate but even soil moisture. Best flowering occurs with regular applications of fertilizer. Propagate by seed or stem/tip cuttings. Shrubs self sow in the landscape. Prune to desired shape. Cut back stems in spring (sometimes to the ground) to promote a bushy rounded growth. Shrubs may survive winter in Zone 8, but to facilitate this climate, stems should be cut back to the ground when winter frosts kill the tops, with application of mulch to the root zone for winter (mound of sand covered with a layer of pine straw). Mulch must be removed in late winter to early spring in anticipation of new growth for the year. This shrub, even with a quality winter mulch, will not survive temperatures that dip below 20 degrees F. In middle zone 9a, they are evergreen into the upper 20’s F.

        "Notes": "Erysimum cheiri, commonly known as common wallflower, is a woody-based herbaceous perennial subshrub in the mustard family that is typically cultivated as a biennial. This plant loves sharp soil drainage as exemplified by its ability to grow in little pockets of gritty soil on stone walls as suggested by its common name of wallflower. It is noted for producing clusters (racemes) of fragrant 4-petaled flowers in a showy spring bloom followed by narrow pendant dehiscent seed pods (siliques). Easily grown in average, dry to medium, well-drained soils in full sun to light shade. Best in full sun in cool northern climates, but appreciates some part shade in the heat of the day in hot southern climates. This flower is a biennial, so self-seeding will be necessary for it to remain in the garden. Sow seed in spring for bloom the following year. Plants may bloom as annuals if seed is planted early enough in spring. Cut back spent flowering stems only after seed has been harvested or has ripened and fallen to the ground.",

This species is relatively short-lived with a life-span of only 10-20 years, except in drier locations where it may persist for longer periods. There are only two main forms in cultivation in Australia. One form is upright and slender with an umbrella-like crown, while the other form is dense and low-growing with pendulous branches drooping to near the ground. The foliage making up its canopy is consists of deep blue-green lanceolate phyllodes. The leaf-like structures measure anywhere from six to twelve inches in length. The blue leaf acacia is thornless and blooms masses of golden-yellow puffball flowers in the early spring. The flowers are scented, and the pods, which are slightly flat and hairless, form slight constrictions around the seeds, and eventually drop from the tree, contain small shiny, black seeds and a fleshy aril.
