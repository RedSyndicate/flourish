        "Notes": "Mashua has photoperiod dependencies for both tuber formation and flowering. Most of the mashua varieties have a critical day length of about 13 hours and begin to form tubers in early September. A few are closer to 12 hours and therefore don’t begin to form tubers until the end of September. Flowering begins a few weeks after tuber. Seed - sow early spring in a greenhouse. Prick the seedlings out into individual pots once they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter. Plant out in late spring or early summer, after the last expected frosts. Division of the tubers in the autumn or spring. In cold winter areas the tubers can be harvested in the autumn after top-growth has died down and they can then be stored in a cool frost-free position until planting them out in the spring. Cuttings of basal stems in the spring. Pot them up into individual pots and place them in light shade in a frame until they are established. Plant out in early summer. formation, in October for most varieties. Pests and diseases do not seem to pose significant constraints to mashua culture.

        "Notes": "Partridgeberry is a creeping, rhizomatous, evergreen, woody vine up to 1.5 feet (50 cm) tall. It roots at the nodes and often forms loose mats. The flowers are borne in axillary, single stalks at the tip of the branchlets. The fruit is a drupe containing eight seeds. Partridgeberry is widely distributed throughout the eastern United States. The stems run along the ground in a vine-like fashion often carpeting an area. The leaves are opposite with a smooth margin and white central vein. White, sometimes pinkish, flowers mature in summer. The sprawling herb produces a shiny, red berry with a tiny dimple and star-shaped marks. It ranges from Newfoundland south to central Florida and from southern Ontario and Minnesota south to eastern Texas. Partridgeberry grows on a variety of sites but generally prefers mildly acidic, well-drained mesic soils. It grows on leached banks, shaded sandstone ledges, and mossy hammocks and bogs. Best grown in organically rich, medium moisture, well-drained soils in part shade to full shade. Tolerates some drought, but best with consistent watering. Stems will root at the nodes to form colonies in optimum growing conditions. Plantings are sometimes d",

Lowland to upland forests, esp. disturbed habitats: thickets, roadsides, fencerows, and even meadows or sandy hills. By means of forked tendrils, it is able to climb adjacent vegetation, shrubs, and trees. On very old vines, the base of the trunk can measure 12\" across, but it is almost always smaller than this. Best grown in deep, loamy, humus-rich, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun. The more sun the sweeter the fruit. Tolerates a wide range of soil conditions, including average garden soils, but must have good drainage. Best sited in a location sheltered from winter winds (preferably a southern facing slope) and well removed from frost pockets. Young growth may be damaged in spring by late frosts. This grape is self-pollinating. For quality fruit production, it needs a support system, training, regular spraying and regular pruning to maximize fruit production. It can withstand the somewhat severe weather conditions in parts of the Eastern and Midwestern U.S. (cold winters followed by hot and humid summers) better than many other types o",

The flowers on the upper branches look like typical pea flowers, hanging in loose pendant clusters (racemes) from leaf axils in August and September. The flowers are about ½ inch long with four slightly asymmetric fused pale green sepals. The five elongate petals may be white, pale pink, lilac or pale purple. The flowers open before fertilization and are usually cross-pollinated (chasmogamy). The flowers are followed by flat, oblong spotted pods that are pointed at both ends and usually contain three or four seeds. The flowers that occur on the lower, lateral branches are inconspicuous, lack petals and do not open (the term for flowers that are self-fertilized without opening is cleistogamous).

        "Notes": "Asparagus racemosus (satavar, shatavari, or shatamull, shatawari) is a species of asparagus common throughout India and the Himalayas. and northern Australia. It grows 1–2 m (3 ft 3 in–6 ft 7 in) tall and prefers to take root in gravelly, rocky soils high up in piedmont plains, at 1,300–1,400 m (4,300–4,600 ft) elevation. Because of its multiple uses, the demand for Asparagus racemosus is constantly on the rise. Due to destructive harvesting, combined with habitat destruction, and deforestation, the plant is now considered \"endangered\" in its natural habitat. The plants can be successfully grown in a variety of soils, but it prefers sandy well drained soil. They can be propagated by seeds and divisions of rhizomatous disc. Seedling should be planted preferably on ridges, 60 in to 60 cm apart. Harvesting is recommended 40 months after plantation.",

Closely related to and similar in habit to Holboellia. Hand pollination may improve fruit set. Propagation by seed. Sow early spring in a greenhouse. The seed can take 18 months to germinate. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots once they are large enough to handle and grow them on in the greenhouse for at least their first winter. Plant them out into their permanent positions in early summer and consider giving them some protection from the cold for their first winter or two outdoors.",

The pendulous, fleshy, nearly cylindrical elongate pods – called beans, and resembling big green beans – are filled with thousands of tiny black seeds. Typically 4-8 pods are allowed to develop from each inflorescence. The pods are harvested when fully grown but not ripe (when the tips become yellow), about 8-9 months after flowering. These fresh vanilla pods do not have any taste because the vanillin is bound as a glycoside and must be released by enzymatic reaction. To accomplish this, the beans are processed by a variety of methods, including heating in the sun, ovens or hot water, or freezing, then are then held under hot and humid conditions (1",

American vetch grows in a wide variety of habitats. It is typically found in moist areas, including swampy woods, mixed forests, sheltered canyons, and clearings, but can also be found in arid locations on hilltops or valley badlands. The inflorescence is a raceme with up to 10 purple flowers approximately 0.5 to 1.5 inches long. Flowering occurs from May to August with the seeds maturing around one month after pollination. American vetch has a moderate to deeply-branched taproot which reaches a maximum depth of 40 inches. The deep tap root allows for the plant to exhibit characteristics of severe drought tolerance.",

Plants are not particularily attractive in spring. There are at least 3 common crownvetch cultivars: 'Penngift', 'Chemung', and 'Emerald'. These cultivars are essentially ecotypes that developed with 20 or more years of natural selection at different sites. Crownvetch reproduces by seed and rhizomes. Rhizome spread and sprouting are important to crownvetch growth and persistence. Crownvetch typically produces seed in its 2nd year of growth, and seeds typically mature 6 to 10 weeks after flower pollination. Crownvetch seedlings are sensitive to cold temperatures, soil acidity, and soil compaction. Seedlings emerging after July will not likely survive the winter.",
